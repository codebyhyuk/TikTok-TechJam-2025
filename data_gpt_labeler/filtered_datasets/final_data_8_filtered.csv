70283,4,"First time we had to wait really long for our meals, I'd had a taste for the turkey dinner and was told only on the day before - not sure but I seem to recall you used to be able to order the daily specials any day, just not at the daily price, which is have paid!!  So I'd asked her to put in my families' orders and come back to me in a few.  I THOUGHT she'd done that but evidently not!!  I wasn't in a mood for steak really but that's what I'd ordered - be sure it's well-done, please, I'd stressed. . . .

. . .

So when all our food arrived, finally, my wife said her hamburger steak was burnt outside, raw inside.

My steak was sorry-looking, they'd ripped it open in order to get it well-done, I assume - they failed, half of it was red inside!!! So I only ate half - at least my grandson likes it rare and ate the other half!!

The Server was GREAT - at first, and towards the end.  However, after she got my order, we never saw her during that long, long, long wait on our food.  We didn't have biscuits or cornbread, no silverware, at least we had drinks!!

Finally, she came out and told us our food would be out soon, to which we asked for bread, and she did get that.  But we still had no silverware and finally flagged her down after we'd devoured our bread, and she got that as well as refill our drinks.

While finishing our meals she kept checking on us, seeing if we needed dessert, etc., and again was very attentive, which is why we left her a nice tip!!

But, that long, long, long wait between ordering and getting, with NO attention or even a view of our server, did not make us happy campers, for sure!!  And some of mine and my wife's food was below par.  Thank goodness our Son and two grandchildren either had no issues or never complained of issues with their food.

Add to that, I could no longer get the old fashioned orange cream soda I used to get here, and being on dialysis I must watch my fluid intake, and my taste buds have been affected, limiting the things I like and what I should or shouldn't have, so, all in all, we always have much better experiences here.

I can and did forgive their having an off-day, but I look forward to better experiences at Cracker Barrel here, moving forward, . . .",Cracker Barrel Old Country Store,"['American restaurant', 'Gift shop', 'Hobby store', 'Restaurant', 'Southern restaurant (US)']","Homey chain restaurant serving American comfort food, with an on-site general store.",1.1409751663659886e+20_1616437978056

The food was out.to us in less than 10 minutes and the chicken and dumplings were both warm and cool. They lacked flavor and it seemed that parts of it sat under a heat lamp while the rest missed. The fried apples were not up to usual part and did not taste all that great. I don't low if it was because we showed up an hour before closing time to enjoy the meal or what but it seems that this Cracker Barrels  kitchen staff need to retrained in how to properly prepare food and how to properly plate food for the runners to bring out.

By the time we finally got our food it was cold, some was burnt, didn't get bacon with one of our meals (waited 15 minutes extra for it after we got the meals), and it was all bland.

71401,2,Cracker Barrel was a disaster. I understand the COVID virus has restaurants scrambling but it would be better to stay closed than have bad service. We were seated almost immediately and the tables were sufficiently spaced. There were very few people in the restaurant. Our waitress came right away and got our drink orders. That's when it started going down hill. After 20 minutes we were getting ready to leave and she finally brought our drinks. We went ahead and ordered since we were there. Part of our order came 30 minutes later. My chicken and dumplings were luke warm at best. My husband received his toast 15 minutes before the rest of his meal.

71473,3,"We rarely eat here, but whenever we do, we are usually reminded why we rarely do business with this particular store. Today, we got a takeout order of fried catfish and medium ribeye and fixings. I had to go back because they forgot a couple of items, my medium ribeye was nt exactly as tough as shoe leather, but it was close. Definitelywwas not medium and they somehow cooked so that it was dry on one side? Weird. The batter for the catfish is a little bland, that's okay because older patrons eat at the store. But, they didn't get much batter on it, so it ended up soggy. Tried to call back to speak to a manager and was put on hold for 5 mins. Hung up and called back, put on hold again. After a couple of minutes, the lady got back on the phone and said the managers were busy. Ended up with the impression that they were not interested in my concerns. I'm sure that others have had good experiences and we used to, a long time ago. For me, there are other places to eat. Guess we'll shop elsewhere from now on.

I couldn't finish because I feared I was eating raw meat. The cook got both orders wrong and the food took a little too long to be cooked considering that it wasn't even cooked right. Might be time to clean house. I gave 2 stars because our server did her very best to meet our needs.

Turns out it was her birthday.
Not only was she a great conversationalist,  the manager went out of his way to offer me a seat near a recepticle if I needed it.

I would return to this restaurant for the above mentioned perks, but I would also return to see if the encouragement to Mary to step out and start her singing career was enough to make her want to take that leap.
Perhaps you folks can persuade her as well.

We were treated bad by the server so we ended up leaving before eating our meal. The server messed up our order and many others around us but tried to blame it on us. He was very unprofessional to say the least!
We love Denny's and have been to many many locations around the country but have never been treated like this.
Would have given 1 star but since the manager was understanding I will give 3 stars.
We ended up going to Waffle House across the way and we were treated like royalty there!

Today (a Friday morning in the summer) I pulled in the line at 8:37 a.m. There were approximately six cars ahead of me. I didn't get my drink until 9:02 a.m.

The parking lot is so small and nearly impossible to navigate if there is a drive-thru line of any length.

And to boot, they didn't know how to make my drink (and verbally told me so), despite having ordered it several times for pick-up through the Starbucks app and at several other locations.

There was no apology for the length of time waiting in line or for not being familiar with how to make my drink (an iced cappuccino).

Even though everything wasn't perfect it was a good experience.

72244,1,I used to love Pizza Hut but I noticed that the delivery driver came to my house and told me that I ordered some pizza and she wanted me to pay for it and I told her I didn't order any pizza and she left my house. I found out that she went to the wrong address. I noticed I tried to order some pizza on February 7th 2021. They told me that the Pizza delivery can't come to my address because they don't delivery at my area and my address. I asked them why and they told me they never delivered in my area they delivered in different other areas which is a lie because they been delivering pizza in my area for years and I been paying for my pizza in my area for years and to find out I can't get delivery in my area anymore which is ridiculous (Ludacris).

72284,3,"So coming from a former employee who worked retail for 2 months, here's my take on Cracker Barrel.

The food is actually pretty good. It's home-cooked meals at a restaurant, but there's nothing too special about it. I will say the waiters have alot of tables they serve, and you're usually waiting for a solid 10-15 mins before they sometimes get around to all their tables. On the retail side of things, it's okay. The stuff they have in the retail section is pretty neat, and I liked the different sections in there. The staff there is pretty cool as well.

Overall, it's still a good place to stop-by and eat, but it's nothing over-the-top special.",Cracker Barrel Old Country Store,"['American restaurant', 'Gift shop', 'Hobby store', 'Restaurant', 'Southern restaurant (US)']","Homey chain restaurant serving American comfort food, with an on-site general store.",1.1050013027137883e+20_1607702348760

Mostly, my comments about what people call ""chicken-fried"" steak or chicken is burned essence from some oil or fat which is wrong or reused. I love the salads. Green beans need different seasoning, but some people think smoke-flavored things are their favorites. It is really good ordinary food. I am glad to visit. They took my suggestion of stuffed eggs, not as a side dish, but accompanying the salad I get. At times it can be a bit noisy, but it is feeling more like a room at home.

72972,1,i have said it before but I gave in and tried once again simply because I do love their rolls however the experience was the same and the service even worse! i ordered or tried to order potato skins for our appetizer and I knew when I said it what I was about to hear from the look on the waitresses face....we're out of potato skins now had this been the first time I had been told this is i could see it but this is not even the 2nd time but the 4th it would be 5 but one sweet little guy brought us a plate of loaded fries and we were just as happy! i am not the person who complains ever it takes alot to get me to this point but they are the worst location ever they have totally ruined  my feelings of the whole franchise. i am sure if corporate came to visit here they would understand. how do you not review your inventory trends to see if you have any concerns or consistently run out of things and may need to adjust accordingly.  Not to mention when I did get my food the chicken was way overcooked and too tough to eat and I had ordered loaded fries as my side and I actually thought for a second she was playing a joke on me because of being out of the skins by putting like 10 fries on my plate but nope it wasn't a joke i literally had maybe 10 it was less than a childs plate no doubt but I didn't bother to say anything to them why would I?? been there done that and u don't even get an apology so I took it with a grain of salt because it was my own fault i knew better! this really will be the last time they rip me off idc how good the rolls are they can keep them wellllllllll unless they run out of those too! sure would not be a shock,Texas Roadhouse,"['Steak house', 'American restaurant', 'New American restaurant']",Lively chain steakhouse serving American fare with a Southwestern spin amid Texas-themed decor.,1.1203329160544331e+20_1564785604299

72975,2,"Just had our meal in there. It was my birthday and the dinner didn't start well and finished worse. Although the food was delicious as usual, and this is our third time coming, the dining experience wasn't pleasant at all.  We asked for a table for 4 even though we were 2 because me and my husband likes to sit together. The boy that took us to the table didn't seem very happy to be there also took us to small table for 2. We told him that we asked for a table for 4, he was annoyed and left the table without saying anything so we followed him to the entrance again. He started arguing with the people in the front desk and took us to our table. The server that served was a delightful lady and was very sweet and accommodating. As I said previously the food was to die for. We had so much leftover so we asked for Togo box. Our server took our card to pay so we say that boy again and asked him for a back, he annoyingly nodded and said ok. But he didn't return, we saw him walking and talking to other waiters. So we asked our server, she also was little late and we were standing waiting for the bag when the boy met our eyes and said ""oh I'll bring you the bag"" of course he didn't. So we left the table with the boxes in our hands but our server followed us and gave us the bag. Before leaving we told her how rude that boy was she said she will talk to the manager. We don't want to force anyone to smile all the time but at least don't look so annoyed to do your job and don't be rude to the customers.",Texas Roadhouse,"['Steak house', 'American restaurant', 'New American restaurant']",Lively chain steakhouse serving American fare with a Southwestern spin amid Texas-themed decor.,1.0227700808714358e+20_1520388475063

I see why the food gets cold by time other customers come in. They barely give you enough. Stop over cooking food that you are not willing to give out. To get my money worth I ask for more while they are fixing it (an adult plate should not look or feel like a kids plate).

Don't visit there 30 minutes before closing because you're just going to be disappointed. I understand that working in fast food is hard and dealing with people is challenging enough but somethings are easily addressed. i.e. if you know you have somethings that's popular make sure when things slow down you replace items that are popular. If you dont like working in fast food make a plan to go further your education and use the time in fast food as a learning curve on how to deal with people professionally at all times, even when you're tired, frustrated and ready to go home.

73902,4,"I am only giving 3 stars because we could not visit the basement where the family lived in this house.  Longwood-or Nutt's Folly (and to see it is to know why it was called that)-started construction in 1860 but stopped in 1861 because of the Civil War. It was to be a very grand mansion with 6 floors and an unusual layout and design but it was never finished.  It is shown as it was when the Pilgrimage Garden Club of Natchez took it over. The family, however, lived in the basement of the house for decades.  However, due to (I believe it was) Hurricane Harvey, the basement was not part of the tour as it was undergoing renovations.  The day was cold with wind whipping through the open space that we toured but our guide was a delight and gave us a really good idea of the place.  I would say that unless you are an architect or like building design, to check to see if the basement is open yet before buying tickets  and be sure to dress warmly if it's a cold day.  You will essentially be doing a 1 hour tour as if you were outside.  Nice gift shop and the grounds are beautiful.

From the tree lined drive up from Hwy 84, to the incredible grounds, the very nice gift shop (I bought a cameo necklace there) to the impressive, massive building called Longwood...unbelievably majestic with family stories that are sweet, sad, real.
John, our tour guide, was pleasant, informative, open to questions and fascinating to listen to as he told the stories of the original owners The Nutt family. The story and reasons why this magnificent place was never finished and not finished to this day. The Nutt Family eventually sold it to a man in Texas who donated it to The Garden Club of Natchez with the stipulation that it be kept 'as is'...in all its unfinished glory. WOW!

The first time I made a 100. order with  a 25. tip and they completely screwed it up... couldn't even get anyone on the phone  even until the following day and didn't even offer to make it right. I mean why would I pay that much for a bunch of (speciality) supreme and meat lovers pizzas, to only get cheese and pepperoni pizzas. Then it took 2 hours to get it,and it was cold and hard. The guy at the door apologized, but the employees in the store are horrible.

We also had this same experience again when we ordered for work on more than one occasion. And the pizza didn't arrive until AFTER their lunch was over when it was guaranteed half an hour BEFORE lunch.

Then I ordered again last night for a 6 year olds birthday at 6:30, and we didn't get it until almost 9, when the kids we're already falling asleep. I spent 50. and gave a 10.tip for this kind of service. Not even worth the paper the receipt was printed on. The  pizza again was cold and hard, the driver was rude, he put it at our back door where the light was off, instead of at our front door where we had our porch light on. And after it had been over an hour when it said 25 minutes I called Pizza hut to cancel my order and order from a local place (who was upfront with us and told us it'd be about an hour but guaranteed hot). However everytime we called (which was about a dozen times) we were told please hold, then put on hold, and no one ever came back to the phone.

This place has really gotten that bad, and we have given them way too many chances.

The restroom was filthy and not just a day's worth. I am talking as in hasn't been cleaned in weeks. I was scared to let my three year old use it because I didn't want him coming into contact with the surfaces.

74206,3,"I'll cut to the chase for those of you who need facts then describe my experience below. Firstly, the restaurant was clean on a busy night. Once seated, a server promptly arrived and took drink orders. Chelsea was our server and she went above and beyond for our party of 10! Food arrived pretty fast and was served hot. I tried the lobster artichoke dip and crab alfredo both were great. Their shrimp scampi was great also.

Now why i rated 3 stars instead of 4 like my previous visit was due to the hostess Barbie. Today it rained cats and dogs which delayed our party's arrival. My husband and I arrived first and asked for seating for a party of 10. Barbie said that we had to wait until the rest of our party arrived to be seated and we understood. Minutes later a white male approached barbie and said his party was also not there yet and she replied, giving him an option, ""Would you like to be seated or wait on them to arrive?""... 15 mins later, due to the weather 4 more of our party arrived including our 85 year old grandmother. Grandma was the guest of honor for Mother's day and slowly walked in needing to sit down. We found her a booth in the waiting area and asked if we could be seated now since we had 6 of the 10 and the rest would be arriving any minute. Barbie said that we had to wait until our entire party arrived! 5 mins later 2 more of our party arrived and barbie still wanted us to wait! The table was ready as it had been for some time. outback or really anywhere else will be our next choice. We didnt feel welcome. Added insult was that She was on her phone in between customers doing who knows what. Maybe a family emergency or a candy crush emergency.

I looked up from my laptop from time to time to see her working harder than most employees not pregnant that sit at a desk all day.

Every time my husband and I have attempted to go eat here we waited at the front for about 15 minutes then once finally seated we waited sometimes up to 20 just to get a waitress to take our drink orders. Every single time (around 3-4) we've gotten up and left and then tried to order food to go instead. When we did this we ordered just two meals (usually dip tickets which is the food already prepared such as a vegetable plate or the dumplings, anything that didn't have to be cooked) and still had to wait about 45 minutes before it was ever brought to the front. Whether it is busy or not time is not a concern for the employees they have now and I noticed it is a lot of younger girls that are either playing or cussing about something in the back which they seemed to do very loudly. When I worked here I made sure people were taken care of and were satisfied with the visit. I feel like it has been totally let go and the cozy family experience is just not there anymore.

74900,5,"I always try to give kudos where they are due. Today's experience with Oby's warrants a review.
We've ordered out at this restaurant many times on our way to Olive Branch, MS and back. Every time the food has been delectable and scrumptious!
Oby's maintains a culture of superior cuisine, great service and a constancy of those qualities. I got a salad today and while I was eating I found a hair in it. I knew I couldn't simply put it aside and continue eating. So, I got out of my car, walked in with receipt in hand and asked for a manager. Immediately the manager appeared and I told him of my dilemma. In the time it took me to visit the ladies room and return to counter, my salad was ready along with my complimentary Diet Coke.
It's that level of professionalism that separates a mediocre restaurant from an exemplary one. I only wish that I could read the manager's signature so as to give credit where credit is so very due. We were there Saturday April 27, 2019 during the noon hour.

74990,2,"After about a years hiatus from Obys because of a bad experience, I decided to give them another shot. I use to love their club salad, and would order it for lunch on a weekly basis.
Well I tried it today and at first it was excellent. The bread was light and crunchy, the tomatoes where ripe, everything seemed great. Then I began to find all the leaf lettuce was brown and soggy. The iceburg was fine. As I placed all the rotten lettuce on my napkin my waiter saw the lettuce and asked me how ""how is everything?"" I replied ""not so good, this lettuce isn't fresh"". He said "" I will go let them know"". About fifteen minutes later he returned to collect my bowl. No mention of the managements thoughts on my soggy salad.
Honestly if they'd just made an effort to resolve my issue I wouldn't have given them such a bad review. But they obviously do not care about their customers. Sad really.

But that's no excuse for the taste and temperature of most of the food. I hurried to make two plates just in case they began to close down the buffet before I had a chance to go back for more food. Sadly to say, I didn't even eat most of the food that I got. It just was not appealing. we used to eat here often, but it seems to have gone down.

The food itself was decent, but seemed somewhat bland.  Not much of a crowd at the time of visit which can also influence taste as the food tends to not be refreshed as quickly as when they are busy.

I took my kids to eat lunch, I had a 15.00 food credit but when I got to the register the cashier was very rude and told me I don't have a 15.00 credit so I would have to go downstairs to the window and try to see if it would pull up there. Never did she seem concerned that I would have to get my kids and go downstairs and come all the way back upstairs. I told the guy at the window what the cashier upstairs said and he told me it was showing that Iam qualified for a 15.00 food credit and to tell the cashier upstairs to call downstairs so they can verify that I can use the credit. I go back upstairs wait in the line again for 20 minutes and get the same cashier and explained to call downstairs and she tells me I can't call downstairs. I was so upset I asked for her manager and NOT ONCE DID THE CASHIER NOR THE MANAGER APOLOGIZED FOR BEING INCONVENIENCE! finally I pay for my kids and go eat and when I sit down to eat every silverware was very dirty!!!!
