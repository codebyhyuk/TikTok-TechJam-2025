40331,5,"At Da Kitchen, is about quality is numbah 1. But even more than that, it's about quantity. This original Da Kitchen, located in the same spot at Kahului's Triangle Square (what a dumb name, but I digress), has been a source of upscale local food. Despite the growing and changing a bit, the place still has it!

Now, you gotta know that the atmosphere is usually a bit hectic and the interior is always LOUD. Also, Da Kitchen has a little bit of an attitude engrained at the institutional level. It's like Da Kitchen is awesome (and always has been) and they know it. It's not that the people aren't friendly nor do the servers neglect you. But the servers, running circuits around the dining room, are almost too busy. This attitude manifested in a super defensive explanation of the restaurant's practice of not providing water unless requested that was typed up and displayed under the plexi tabletop. While the water policy is no longer displayed, I now have major guilt about ever having water at a restaurant. (Do you know it costs big bugs to wash da cup you wen use?)

The location recently underwent a bit of a renovation and there are some tradeoffs. First, the sassy note  The dining room now fits a lot more people. When I went last, there was no line (granted, I was there a little after the lunch rush). It was probably a better place for groups before they removed the oversized booths (seriously, they would seat like 8 people). But it's still okay for small-to-medium size groups. Just know that you're gonna have to wait for adjacent parties to leave so that tables can be put together.

Sure, the prices have spiked, but you'll for sure have enough for leftovers! And it's definitely a prime first and last stop on the way from or to the airport (and you'll want those leftovers for any long flight!).",Da Kitchen,"['Hawaiian restaurant', 'Restaurant']",Local go-to for traditional Hawaiian plate lunches serves hearty portions amid a low-key atmosphere.,1.0421818495576264e+20_1413402570015

I recommend you take one or two of them on your way back down from the main attraction. They are less crowded and offer closer and better views of the waterfall.

Dress for cool weather. Another reason to drive up early, you'll have the entire lookout for yourself, and truly great if you brought your photography gears with you. There are several lookouts, and you'll be tempted to stop at every single one of them. The road eventually ends at the Kalalau valley lookout. Yet another reason to be there early is because of visibility, try to avoid afternoon drives because the clouds descend by that time. You'll see nothing but clouds at the Niihau island lookout area.

Only unfortunate item in my experience is some peoples inability to drive narrow mountain roads or they over estimate their ability to drive four wheel drive vehicles on rough roads so know your abilities and treat other drivers appropriately.

It is not as large and deep, but it is stunningly beautiful. The rust red soil contrasts the green vegetation and has amazing cuts from the natural erosion over years of rainwater runoff. This State park has great signs explaining the history and evolution of the area along with how the first inhabitants of the island used the vegetation to live and grow into a civilization. It is amazing that they do not charge an entrance fee. This is definately a must see area and a fantastic hiking location.  Make sure you have a hat and plenty of water.

40615,5,"Waimea Canyon and Kokee State Parks are two of KAUAI'S natural gems. Situated on the west side of the island 17 miles and roughly 4000 ft above Waimea Town, this state park some of the most breathtaking views and inspiring hikes. At almost every mile marker there is a possibility of an epic photo. Check out my photo for a listing of all hikes in both state parks.

Remember to enjoy responsibly. Do not pass any sections that are marked as off limits, do not hike out of your comfort zone, and ensure someone is with you or knows where you are. These hikes are not necessarily long but the elevation gain and loss adds alrererendnloss level of intensity that changes their dynamic. Bring plenty of water and the proper footwear.

Lastly, respect the Aina. The only way a natural wonder stays this pristine  is through care and love. Pack out what you pack in, cleanup after yourself, stay on the trail, and stay safe.

40674,5,"The beginning part of the journey up Waimea Canyon Drive is incredibly deceptive. It is dry and barren and quite unimpressive apart from the view back towards Waimea.
Keep driving and your perseverance will be rewarded. The first stunning sight that is revealed is a series of waterfalls tumbling over a red dirt hill.
A short drive leads to a turn for the car park for the Waimea Canyon lookout.
I recommend that you save the lookout for your return trip.
Instead, keep driving to the Kalalau Valley Lookout and, at the very end of the road, the Pu'u O Kila Lookout. The views are absolutely breathtaking and best seen early before the clouds roll in.
On the way back, you can stop at the Waimea Canyon Lookout which is largely unaffected by the weather, unlike the Kalalau Valley Lookout and the Pu'u O Kila Lookout.

40921,5,"This park is stunning. As you drive up Waimea Canyon drive, there are tons of photo spots and places to pull over. You will have 8 million photos, because everything is so pretty. Try and bring a camera that is either not a phone camera or if it is a phone, take some panorama shots- we found those to be the best at actually capturing what we were seeing. If it is cloudy, wait a minute! Sometimes the clouds move so fast that it clears up in a minute or two, you just have to be patient. We went all the way to the end of the road, and tried to to the Pihea trail hike that preceeds the swamp trail. We went quite a ways but it started raining, so we went back. It's not a hike I would recommend in the rain, especially for beginners as it can get very slippery with all the clay mud.

41024,5,"This is the most beautiful place I've ever seen. Absolutely stunning.

I laughed when I saw other people downgraded it because their rental car overheated on the trek from sea level to more than 4,500 feet in elevation by the end of the road at the 19-mile mark or they went on a day when the canyon was clouded in.

The Canyon Trail accessed from the Pu'u Hinahina Lookout jut past the 13-mile marker comes out on a ridge near Waipo'o Falls. There are breathtaking views there. Just don't venture too far along the edge. It's a 700-foot fall.

The most magnificent view are from the Pu'u o Kila Lookout at the end of the road. It looks into the Kalalau Valley on the Na Pali Coast. An unforgettable sight.

It's been a long time since I been to this location.  The parking lot was empty and we were the only ones parked and in the restaurant at the time. A few moments went by and 2 other customers came in. This location appears to be struggling. I'm so happy we came in today. To give blessings to this local Dennys. I remember baised on my previous review 5 years ago this was an amazing place to eat. However,  service was very good and fast. I need to come back here often. As long as they remain clean I'll be coming back.

Love this location. We are regulars and it's good to walk in and the staff know what you want. Amber is the best.

We told what we wanted and gave us time to look at the menu. When he returned, we gave him our orders.Thats when he informed us that they didn't have any prime meats or hamburgers. (wouldn't you think that it would have been the first thing he should have told us when we first sat down.) Now here we sat... With a drink thats already served to us! And were forced to change our meal order to Breakfast! To make the matters worse, he had a cocky attitude when we wanted to make a last minute change. His facial expression made it  like we were there to serve him instead of vice versa. I found out later after our encounter with him was that alot of friends and family who dined there, knew of him and his bad service!

The restaurant was clean, bathrooms clean.  We were seated promptly and even got to choose where we sat.  Our server was friendly and available whenever we needed anything.   The food was as good as remembered and I learned something new, you can substitute Angel hair pasta for regular spaghetti which is really great with the mushroom sauce and mizithra cheese combbo plate.  The broccoli is awesome.  Decent wine selections which are not through the roof expensive...  lovely place to have a casual meal and revelry with good friends or family.

Why? Because from 6 to 7 PM daily all their fresh baked goods in their display cases are HALF OFF!. It does not apply to the stuff on their shelves like cookies, sanwhiches, loaf bread.

Personally I like their snow puffies, turn overs and old fashioned doughnuts.

I don't think it was normal for them to run out of snow puffies but we waited along with maybe thirty other people it was very hot but you could buy cups of Jell-O and some drinks from the refrigerator or water from the store next door.

42089,4,"The experience at Pulehu is of an almost elegant restaurant.   It is open to the Ka'anapali beach air.  The lighting is wonderful.  The space is generous.  The glassware is fine.  But where are the tablecloths?

So the ambiance is -- almost -- first rate.  The service IS top notch.

But the food is just on the high side of so-so.   And that, after all, is why you go to a restaurant, isn't it?

So overall, Pulehu is better than its food.

The prices though, are what you'd expect from a high-end hotel restaurant, so the value just isn't there.

As for that recommendation for the canonical friend, I seldom choose hotel restaurants, and I only recommend them when they are truly outstanding.","Pulehu, An Italian Grill","['Italian restaurant', 'Bar', 'Restaurant']","Classic Italian dishes with an island twist served in a rustic-chic, open-air space at the Westin.",1.0560792346392055e+20_1544291197241

Burger was legit one of the best burgers I've ever had. Fish tacos were fresh and perfect. Truffle fries were cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and perfectly seasoned.

42472,5,"This is a must-see when in Honolulu.  I knew the basics about Pearl Harbor, but was too young to really understand a lot of it.  When you come here, it changes you and really moves you.  The tour begins with a video explaining how everything happened.  When you get to the memorial, it's hard not to picture yourself as one of the sailors that was there that dreadful day.

The memorial is beautiful.  Seeing all of the remnants of the ships is incredible.  They're massive.  It's hard not to picture what it used to look like before that day.  Someone at the memorial had said to remember that ""the ships below are not only sunken ships....they're a graveyard.""  He was right.  They couldn't recover all of the bodies, so some of their bodies are still underneath the memorial.

The wall showing all of the names of people lost was moving.  It brought me to tears.  Seeing each of those names, you want to read them all and think of who they were as people.  It's absolutely breathtaking and worth every moment you get to spend there.

We also did the submarine tour which was awesome.  Very, very tight quarters, but amazing.  You don't get that opportunity too often.  It was amazing to see all the details and what they put into such tiny little spaces to make it seem relatively big.

Address:
1 Arizona Memorial Road
Honolulu, HI. 96818

Type that address in and you'll arrive at the parking lot.
They do not allow backpacks, purses, fanny packs, camera bags, luggage, diaper bags or shopping bags. Leave it in your car. OR check it in at their lockers - they charge extra but I'm not sure how much.

Once you enter, grab a ticket. You will watch a 25 minute documentary (really interesting) and then you will take a free boat ride to the USS Arizona Memorial (also free) and then you come back and then you can take a walk around.

This place is open from 7:00am - 5:00 pm. First tour starts at 7:45 am and last tour is at 3:00 pm)

42616,5,"A very sobering and well done place of remembrance of the men and women who died in or around the Pearl Harbor attack. Everyone associated with the running of the facilities seemed to be very nice and attentive. We had to wait 2 hours to get on the ride to go over to the Arizona Memorial.

Since we had a wait we did the Submarine called the USS Bowfin. What an amazing journey this sub took in WW2. Take the tour!! It's WELL worth it. You will see, feel, smell and hear the sounds of what the brave soldiers went through while riding underneath the water and sinking 44 ships.

There are plenty of food and drink vendors there to keep you happy and refreshed. Lots of nice shopping stores there to buy memorabilia too.

There are a number of walk-thru type tours you can go around and see and hear presentations of what happened during the attack. One tour is all about the USS Bowfin. One of the attack itself. Other displays showing an actual Japanese secret torpedo from the era. Lots of cool flags, badges, letters, artifacts and even periscopes, big guns and missiles you can view into or take pics with.

Once on the ride over to the Arizona, it was a very sobering but yet a very thankful and grateful feeling came over us.

Overall, this is a wonderful voyage back in time. It's amazing that some of those items made it through and are still here today to enjoy and learn about. Great for the whole family.

I arrived at 6:30 a.m. and the site ticket office opens at 7 a.m. Admission to the USS Arizona Memorial is free, but tickets are issued at a first come first served basis, as a boat trip to the site is required. Prior to the boat trip, a 20 minute video presentation is included and a prerequisite to reach the boat at its conclusion. The visit to the USS Arizona is a solemn occasion. The memorial structure straddles the sunken ship which can still be seen through the clear water and entombed within it are 1177 souls. The Wall of Honor listing the dead is a very moving experience. From the ticket office, you can purchase tickets to the USS Missouri and the Bowfin Submarine as well as the Pacific Aviation Air Museum.

I hope they can repair the damaged part of the  memorial platform so that the American people can experience the entire tribute that this memorial is about.

43255,5,"I love everything about these memorials. The Arizona memorial is free of charge, but you have to make sure you get tickets. During the summer months they can be hard to come by as they are on a first come, first serve basis. They escort you in to a room first where you watch a 15 minute video about the attack on Pearl Harbor. Then they lead you out to a boat that takes you to the memorial. You are then granted about 20 minutes to walk around the memorial and pay your respects. Then they take you back. The museum that accompanies the Arizona is a wonderful way to understand the beginning and middle of the war and how it affected the island of Oahu. The Bowfin is a good tour, full of lots of information. I would suggest getting the audio tour because the cramped space of the submarine it's nearly impossible to traverse it ""with"" someone. Works out a lot better if you have your own audio tour and they have theirs, then you can share your experiences after. The main site is totally free to walk around and read the many information boards. It's also a very good time for reflection, try and be respectful of those that are there to pay their respects.

From the huge loss of life on that infamous day, to the massive efforts to restore and rebuild so many of these historic Battleships and final surrender deck and end to the war in the Pacific.

Definitely worth getting in a little earlier as the crowds get a bit larger in the afternoon. There are plenty of places to eat,drink as well as restrooms and shops. You can easily spend half a day here.

The best part for me was to stand right where the peace treaty of world war II was signed. It felt like a dream to be here.

I enjoyed the other monuments in this area as well but it felt almost disrespectful to be happy at those memorials.

Since the Arizona memorial was closed it was the closest we came, but it felt very ""right"" to have the start of the US' involvement in the war, and it's conclusion in one place.  The Arizona is well protected by this sleeping giant.  The plaque marking the spot of the surrender and the documents (repros I think) were very moving.  So many people gave their lives.  There is a flag up on the exterior bulkhead by the surrender site, with 31 stars that MacArthur brought to the surrender - it was Commodore Perry's flag that he carried to Japan when he opened trade between our countries in the mid 1800s.  MacArthur had a flair for staging an event!  Tiny details thought through.  You can do a tour or go self-guided as your ticket gets you an audio tour device.

44840,5,"After we finished the Aviation Museum we got picked up and we were taken to the USS Missouri. Once our group was semi sort of together we we given to an English speaking tour guide Val, she was great by the way.
She walked us through the main deck of the ""Mighty Mo"" given us a lot of information of the Battleship, and it is best remembered as the site of the surrender of the Empire of Japan which ended WWII on Sept 2nd 1945 in Tokyo Bay.
While we walked along the way you can see a dent just below the main deck level of the Missouri. It turns out a low flying Kamikaze hit it and only made very minimal damage. The remains of the pilot were recovered on board, the crew wanted to get rid over the side. But Captain Callaghan decided the young pilot had done his job to the best of his abilities, and with honor, so he should be given a military funeral. The next day he was buried at sea. Val informed us since they had no Japanese flags around, the crewmembers managed to find a way to make one before burying him at sea. You see the footprints made of where it was done.
After she concluded her part of the tour we were left to tour by ourselves, we were just told one thing "" don't take pictures of (I can't remember which side of the ship lol) because that's still an active military base"" So we climbed our short butts to the top deck to take some pictures lol of the side that we could.

44861,4,"This is a very interesting memorial and fascinating to tour the ship which has been kept in such excellent condition - partly because of course it was renovated for active service in the 1980s, and also through the efforts of the preservation team.

The Heart of the Missouri tour was well worth the extra for a guided tour into the more private areas lower down the ship, with a knowledgeable guide.

The only issue which prevents me giving it 5 stars is that the website is really not very good.  Obviously written by people who understand the system, we found it difficult to bolt on the Heart Of Missouri tour to the main tickets - quite time consuming and frustrating.

Also when waiting to board the ship, we were made to wait in a queue to be processed through a photographic stage, despite saying we did not want our photographs taking.  So we waited 10 minutes to be allowed to get to the front of the queue just to decline the pics and board - it's just unnecessary and irritating",Battleship Missouri Memorial,"['Historical place', 'Historical landmark', 'Tourist attraction', 'War memorial']","Historic battleship, which was the site of the official Japanese surrender in WWII, offers tours.",1.0400883022760293e+20_1558381307107

45125,5,"During our 5-night stay at Four Seasons Resort Oahu at Ko Olina in late June, 2018, we visited this Battleship Missouri Memorial after visiting USS Arizona Memorial. Frequent shuttle buses connected Battleship Missouri Memorial and WWII Memorial Park where USS Arizona Memorial was located. As we approached Battleship Missouri, we became awe struck by the majestic battleship ahead of us. Passing by the life size cutout of a U.S. sailor kissing a stranger nurse at NY Times Square in an exhilarating celebration of the WW II V-J Day, we climbed up to the deck to explore the ship. The ships' mighty guns, situation room, computer room, the rooms with pictures of the ship's past engagements in multiple wars, crews quarters, engine rooms, messhall, and armored decks were all very impressive. Above all, the historical spot on the main deck, where Japanese delegations and Allied Nations' delegation led by General McArthur signed the documents ending WWII with Japan's surrendar, was most impressive and memorable.

We decided against waiting in line again so we just went around on our own. They were doing the deck restoration or the teak wood deck when we were there.

Once we started below deck, we understood why - the fact that the ship was retrofitted in the 80's means that you get all of its glory (or lack thereof), which means ""old"" but not in an interesting historical way. So many of the passageways were deserted and sparsely documented, it just felt a bit creepy being so alone in such a large space. I hope in the future more will be done to restore the interior, so my advice would be to skip below the deck (or just do a brief tour), and move onto other sites in the Monument.",Battleship Missouri Memorial,"['Historical place', 'Historical landmark', 'Tourist attraction', 'War memorial']","Historic battleship, which was the site of the official Japanese surrender in WWII, offers tours.",1.024080858973304e+20_1477060579557

46221,1,"Eating at Pizza Hut was a routine part of my life growing up, but the Pizza Hut here in Brandon, Mississippi is filled with the most utterly incompetent, uncaring, and unfriendly employees I have ever had the disservice to meet in any encounter with a business.  I just ordered three orders of cheese sticks from this location with three extra marinara sauce.  When I arrived at the drive thru I received two orders and four cups of marinara sauce.  I explained to the employee at the window that I had ordered three orders and all she wanted to do was point out they charged me for two.  She finally called the manager over, who clearly should not be the manager of anything, and all she did was explain the same thing and tell me I could order another, pay for them, and wait 15 minutes for them to get done, all the while messing with her phone.  Regrettably, I paid for what I got and left.  I wish I had left and not bought anything.  I will never return to this Pizza Hut, which is unfortunate since they have a nice, albeit dirty play area where my kids enjoy spending time.  I simply cannot justify giving my hard earned dollars to a business owner who clearly has no desire to improve the quality of employees so that they can at least do their job.",Pizza Hut,"['Pizza delivery', 'Chicken wings restaurant', 'Takeout Restaurant', 'Pizza restaurant']",Family-friendly chain known for its made-to-order pizzas.,1.0874952466778875e+20_1503708040836

Honestly, I don't want to waste my time using the free pizza coupon because it is just that nasty. The reason why I am so mad is because I buy additional food whenever I use the coupon.

46656,3,"Revised review..Called to see if the dining room was open with booths available and was told yes. So we arrived at around 5:40 and I ask for a booth and was told that the booths are only for parties of 4 or larger. They have large party booths and smaller ones.   we've  sat at a both with 2 before. Seated at small table.  We had a cute little girl seated next to us,  running the entire time all around the dining room and running circles around us and hiding between my chair and the wall.  She almost ran into a server who had her hands full of plates. I was not happy having to watch  the 2 empty booths our entire meal, as we were paying and leaving they were finally seated with 2 PARTIES OF 2!!!  When I called I wish I had been told only parties of 4 and up were allowed at booths.  I'm disabled and booths are always a better option for me. Service was ok. We ordered what we've had in the past. We come at least once a month. I always get the full size bbq pork sandwich. Last time I ordered it I thought they gave me the smaller one by mistake but I didn't question it as they were very busy. This time it was the same. Its almost half the size it used to be. My daughter made the same comment. Times are tough so im sure they are just cutting costs.

47368,3,"This was an interesting experience. It was our first time diving out since the pandemic started. There was a wait which was expected considering the current circumstances. The wait for a table wasn't long once we got on the list. The unorganized, uncomfortable wait in line to get on the list took over 15 minutes. The hostess stand was well inside the gift shop which caused the line to wind through the gift shop and not everyone waiting exercised social distance. Once we were seated, it took no time for our server to approach. She was super friendly and effective. Our food was served hot and prepared just as requested. Then we saw the strangest thing that actually reduced the stars here. We saw another server was tasked with cleaning the menus after the guests before they were returned to the hostess using the same dingy towel over and over again. She had a spray bottle of what might have been disinfectant spray but she never used it and she never cleaned her towel or exchanged it for a new towel. Disgusting! The 3 stars are for our actual server and her friendliness. For me, the experience was ruined by the unsanitary practices and the wait time to get on the list.

47551,1,"Awful! I will never go to this location again. It took 45 mins to get our food and even then, some of the sides were missing which meant more wait time. The food was warm but not hot and was sub par at best.

Our waiter was nice enough and attentive enough, but the wait was uncalled for. We arrived at a time that should normally be a dinner rush but they were not busy at all. Now I understand why! I have always loved Cracker Barrel, but this was not a good experience. My daughter is six months pregnant and we had a 3 and 5 year old with us. Kids don't do well waiting that long when they are hungry

To top everything off,  I think we were overcharged. We asked about the price of the kid's meals at the register, and the girl at the register was really rude. Her answer was ""I don't know,"" instead of finding out. The prices weren't on the kid's menus. She also kept talking to someone about gum over her headset instead of taking care of us.

My 5 year old grandson chose the place to eat because it was his reward for making a 100 on his math test. It was a 30 min drive to get there and a total waste of time and money. We were all very disappointed.",Cracker Barrel Old Country Store,"['American restaurant', 'Gift shop', 'Hobby store', 'Restaurant', 'Southern restaurant (US)']","Homey chain restaurant serving American comfort food, with an on-site general store.",1.1395781121667283e+20_1552052783195

47884,1,"Mr. Neely, I called your establishment close to 8pm tonight and tried to make a to go order after the young man explained to me what was included in a 12 pack pulled pork combo. He told me that your establishment doesn't take to go orders an hour before closing. He said I would either have to come through the drive thru or come in to place my order. My husband and I left our home and arrived at your establishment at 8:30pm. We drove thru the drive thru first, but no one would assist us. We then parked and my husband attempted to go inside to order. The door was locked. There were at least three young men and a young lady inside who saw him at the door. Instead of assisting him, they started laughing and giving each other high fives! This is not the type of service we expected from your business. We left your establishment and went to your competitor Tops Barbeque and the drive thru was busy and so was the inside. My husband went inside, placed our order and had our food in a matter of minutes. The service was great!  We've always loved your barbeque but with service like we received tonight, We Won't Be Back!! We thought you deserved to know how your employees are running your business!

After waiting around 40 minutes we started to get a little irritated that the food wasn't there. We asked the waiter and he said it would be soon. At 10:20, a full hour later, the waiter came back and said that they were missing half of our order and that they would start on it now. I asked to speak to the manager at this point. She came out and was very rude and aggressive. Before I got to even say anything she went off on me about how they had to make the pancake batter and it takes a while to make it and did not offer a single apology. We told her we wanted to cancel it and she said, ""okay, fine"". As we got up to leave our waiter started to walk out with our food and she yelled at him and said, ""take it back! They said they don't want it anymore!"". This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. I've never seen a manager behave so childish and unprofessional.

48540,4,"We stopped here during a road trip in the middle of the week about mid afternoon. The location was clean. Access in and out of the roadways wasn't difficult. The drive thru had adequate space for a larger truck to go through easily. There was only one car in line in front of us. There were about 4 cars in the parking lot. The person taking our order at the drive thru did have some difficulty with customized orders. For instance: No Whip (no whipped cream). The wait was terribly long to get to the window. The person ahead of us ordered only one beverage. As we looked inside there appeared to be only one customer in the store. The person working the drive thru seemed to be frazzled. Our orders were incorrect but we kept them anyway. The wait was too long to ask for what we ordered. We were on a road trip so we didn't have time to be picky. We didn't notice initially but the cups were very sticky. I think some Syrup was spilled and we didn't get a fresh cup or have the cup wiped clean. We didn't receive any napkins either. Maybe the staff was having a bad day. Maybe I expect better because my local Starbucks does such a phenomenal job on all these things. Overall, the beverages were still acceptable and enjoyed.

48710,2,"Lets start with the food.  It's on par with what you expect from a Pizza Hut.  This is a massive chain, so you know what the consistency of their pizza is.

This location frustrated me with the service however.  My order was supposed to be ready for pickup at a time well before the lunch crowd.  I showed a few minutes early with the expectation to wait.  15 minutes later my pizza was done (it only takes 20 minutes to cook, so they were obviously late getting it in the oven).  The dessert however took another 30 minutes of standing around waiting before it was done.  At 10 minutes before I got the food, I was told it would be done in 5.

The two people working this location either need some help, time management assistance, or motivation.  The fact that I waited that long for my food while I heard the manager tell people theirs would be done in 20 minutes is frustrating too.

Beyond the timeliness, there was a severe lack of concern when the staffing spoke to me.  The timing is what frustrated me, but this apathy is why I am posting a review.

49050,3,"Stick to the pizza! We've enjoyed the pizza quite a few times so far, but decided to branch out today. Ordered a sub with no red onions - it ended up being piled high with them. I tried to get them all out, but missed quite a few that were hiding between the meat layers or melted into the cheese. Looks like I'll be popping the Rolaids tonight! The sub was promising otherwise - toasted like a grinder. We also tried the Cinna Squares. Not bad, but they forgot the frosting! I didn't notice until after I got back home and emptied the bag. I've gotten used to having to check my takeout orders at fast food places, but didn't think I'd have to here. Fortunately, the pizza was as good as usual.

I haven't minded paying a little more for a good pizza, but I almost always get something else (wings, sides, etc.) with the order. So even if the pizza's great, the team needs to be on target with the rest of the order.

Over the past several visits I have had issues with my order. I usually order online so I know what time the order is supposed to be ready. But each time the past 3 or 4 visits I have arrived 10-15 min after the ready time and the order was either not ready or missing something. No apologies or concessions were made. This last time I waited maybe 30 min beyond the ready time. Same thing.

Increasing my rating. Seems that this place is trying harder, last two orders were great. Keep it up.

Update: ordered carryout this time with a free coupon and the toppings were scant even though I ordered extra toppings. They did throw cold pineapple on top though. Gross. If it wasn't free I wouldn't order it. The staff need trained on how to cook a pizza.

Ordered delivery and it took over an hour to get it. I called to inquire and they were unapologetic about it. When i looked at the ticket I have to sign, it showed they didn't even accept and print the order out for 45 min after I placed it. My pizza was cold and had barely any cheese and there were places where the cheese looked like it had been scraped away and all that was left was sauce. Garlic stuffed bread was stale and mostly hollow. Wings were good but the rest was Nasty.  Pizza hut is literally 5 min away from my home. Unacceptable. I emailed corporate and they made it right with coupons but this locations service is terrible. The delivery driver, a young black male, seemed nice.

No one came to see what I needed. Went ahead to the buffet and got some pizza. Still Noone asked what I needed to drink. Finally went to the front and grabbed a glass and made myself a drink. Set back down to finish. More pizza finally came out so I went to get more. I had to ask for plates due to none at the pizza counter. Was told they were in the washer and would be a few minutes. There are now several people looking for plates. I just went back and reused the plate I already had because there were no clean ones. Before I finished eating, a waitress came around and gave me the check. Never got any assistance from them until time to pay. This was my last chance.

As we got up to leave, the manager came out and helped us so we sat back down. We were then greeted by a young kid who was clearly not a server but he was polite. We went to get a salad and there was no silverware rolled and the salad dressings were hardly stocked.  When we got our food, the pizza was undercooked. I just had my wisdom teeth taken out so wasn't eating anyway. My niece and nephew ate it and said the flavor was good.

49724,4,"Service for pick-up is always friendly, helpful, exactly what I ordered, and exactly on time. I've never had a bad experience picking up an order after years of being an 'every-other-week' customer.

Standing at the counter and watching activity on the floor, it's obvious that they're understaffed or whoever is doing the scheduling needs to pay better attention to peak times. The server was running her butt off and doing her best in an impossible situation. (This isn't a one time thing either. I see it many times when I'm there for a pick-up.)

Remember that dine-in customers pay for cleanliness and service more than they pay for the food. If you're hungry, even sub-par food tastes great, but they'll always remember bad dine-in service.

Eat the cost of a month of higher than normal payroll for a month or so, provide better service and you'll see that your customer base will increase.
