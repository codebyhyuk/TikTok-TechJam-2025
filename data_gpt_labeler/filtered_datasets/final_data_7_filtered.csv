60023,1,"Today I ordered 3 cheeseburgers for the family. Usually the burger that gets messed up is mine that I never noticed until I get home, but today I decided to check the burgers before I left the restaurant and my daughters burger was not correct. All they had to do was put swiss cheese, pickles and bacon which cost extra, it had American cheese only ,no pickles or bacon, so I sent it back.... it came back with swiss cheese still no pickles or bacon, sent it back with the receipt for them to get it right, came back this time with lettuce, swiss cheese, still no pickles or bacon, sent it back again. Then the manager or who they said was the manager later after I asked to speak to the manager. I was told that the manager wouldn't talk to me cause I cursed at her, which didn't happen, which every customer standing at counter said that I didn't ,it was just her way of not dealing with me, sent it back again, in the meantime my other burger and fries are getting cold, then I heard her saying to cashier that was taking my food back for the fourth time, just put everything on and he can take off what doesn't belong on it. I questioned that and then someone came from the back and threatened to call the cops on me because I cursed at the manager, which like I said no one heard me say, the burger finally came back still with lettuce, but it had the swiss cheese, pickles and bacon, so I accepted it, I just asked if they could just replace the fries, which to my knowledge they did. I'm retired military  so I've eaten at Denny's in and out of the United States and this is the worst experience of my life, I felt so  helpless, never gave me the managers name when I wanted to report this to corporate, I was told that this store was a franchise and there was no one to contact.

60034,2,"I'm not overly picky about service, but my service today was so bad that I had to write a review.  First, our waitress took quite a while to come take our order. Then, when she finally came around, she seemed like she was completely unconcerned--well, actually, more like we were bothering her. When she brought out the food, my friend noticed her tots smelled a little weird and mentioned it to the waitress. Who again seemed more like we were bothering her than anything else.    They did get her a substitution for her tots. However, my order was also wrong and when it was sent back to correct it, she returned with the same thing sloppily thrown together with burned meat on it.  At this point, I had enough. I asked for the check and had my meal removed.  The one bright spot was the much more professional acting Jasmine--who tried her best to help and is the only reason I'm giving two stars.

However, the recent two very rude waitresses purposely left us hanging with little to no interest to serve us as guests. We were never greeted AT ALL as they purposefully avoided us so we can eventually leave. Regardless of what you perceive of customers it is YOUR job to serve these customers whether you like them or not. I understand servers plight because I have served in the restaurant business and understand the stressors of one, but that doesn't excuse me to have such a despicable attitude towards people. EVER.

With this being stated, we indeed called the manager and discussed this incident. She apologized (at first) and said she'll call us back. Never received a call back from her, and about two weeks later when we called again we gotten the most nastiest attitude- accusing us as being discriminatory towards the waitress?? Hah, we are far from discriminatory.

With this being said, I will NEVER set foot in this ridiculous joint of a business ever again. And for best advisories, I recommend that you do not either. I recommend business structuring ASAP before your franchise closes down!",Denny's,"['Diner', 'American restaurant', 'Breakfast restaurant']","Casual diner chain dishing up classic American comfort fare, including all-day breakfast favorites.",1.1435540484138323e+20_1545418433929

I got eggs with very runny whites and no way I'm eating that! I had all bacon and no sausage. My daughter asked for white gravy and got brown. The staff seems scarce and very unorganized and for as long as it took for us to place our order and then receive it I would think it would have been perfect, but no.

I went back up to the counter with a tip in my pocket and asked for a roll with salmon. And he tried to say no about something but I couldn't understand. So I get a roll with no salmon in it, just cucumber and avocado and I tell him it's wrong, I wanted salmon. And he just said no salmon and walked off. So I'm not sure if maybe there is a limit I'm unaware of, or they'd actually run out of salmon after having just made me some, or if the chef was just extremely rude and didn't want to be arsed about it.

62200,3,"I came to P.F. Chang's with a couple of friends for the first time. Restaurant is clean and the ambiance that is trying to be created is more of a ""fine dining experience"". Our waitress was very friendly, courteous and checked up on us appropriately. I ordered the Thai harvest curry. My friend ordered the chicken pad Thai with a side of spinach and my other friend ordered changs spicy chicken. Our food was literally brought to us within ten minutes. I would describe the food quality more along the lines of  fast food Chinese, just with a nicer dining experience. The harvest curry was slightly spicy and was more sweeter than most coconut curries I'm used to. There was no specific wow factor to the food. For dessert we ordered the great wall of chocolate cake which we were told is made fresh daily. The cake was moist but the icing was just store bought quality out of a can in my opinion.

She had been walking around the dinning area. We wisely ordered drinks and food on her arrive. It was the only time she came to our table except when I stopped her and ask for our bread. A few minutes later she begrudgingly brought our bread 30 sec before a gentleman, management type, brought our food. Oh, by the way both of us could not get what we wanted, they were ""out"". Any way, I was short one of my sides, the one they were out of and didn't tell me 'till they brought my food. He said he would go back and get it, not. I got my side when I was nearly done, but not from him but from the lady who sat us and told the waitress to wait on us. I had stopped her and asked to check on the side. She also later brought our check. I told her later that she was literally holding that restaurant together single handedly.  And yes, the gentleman did return with my side while we were loading a togo box. It nice and hot I ate it was good.

62490,2,I was lucky to get my food faster than most. My co-worker who arrived shortly after me but was seated at another table never got his food. My waitress who was there 2 weeks ago when I ate lunch was said to be new. 2 weeks? She should be in a better spot with her serving. She was sweet and engaging but to seat for 5 minutes before anyone says anything to you then have another server have to get your server for you isn't good. Then 5 minutes later no drink and the same server who checked on me had to get my drink for me plus stepped in to basically become my server. My food my dessert were brought out fast by her. Without her help not sure i would have had time to eat and make it to work. Food is consistent and good but kitchen was behind and add in service thats not at its best means a negative experience for most. Hope this helps.

I recommend Cato for all of your must have wardrobe basics for that very reason. Excellent plus size collection. Reasonably priced and down right cheap when you buy from the clearance rack! Clean dressing rooms. No public restroom. Wheelchair parking and accessibility. My only complaint is that they have the latest clothing trends hanging on the wall higher than I can reach myself and there's not always enough staff to pull things down for me. That also makes me feel awkward bc trendy items are usually quick to need to be returned to the wall after a just holding it next to my body. Trendy clothes are usually easy to determine if they will compliment my body shape and size. Generally friendly staff but like everywhere else, there's going to be one bad apple during one visit or another one.

Sounds great, right? Well, you may wait an hour to be seated, all the while being hounded by Paula Deen's doppelganger to buy ""this pretty shirt"" and listening to the greatest hits from none other than Toby Keith and friends.

Your server will probably never refill that Coke which runs you about a buck for every refill and when it's time to pay, don't forget to say hello to Ms. Deen and Mr. Keith while you wait in line for another 5-10 minutes.

Oh, and most of that stuff isn't reasonably priced, so don't bring your kids if you don't want to buy them some little doo-dad that they saw in the toy section.",Cracker Barrel Old Country Store,"['American restaurant', 'Gift shop', 'Hobby store', 'Restaurant', 'Southern restaurant (US)']","Homey chain restaurant serving American comfort food, with an on-site general store.",1.0429657481023737e+20_1481364465339

I went to see Sonic and I tossed and turned the entire movie due to my butt and back were very uncomfortable in the tiny seats. I guess they decided not to clean the movie theater after the previous showing because it was a hot mess upon entering. The walls are extra thin because I heard Bad Boys playing in the next cinema.

The family was funny, and the father switched spots with his son. I didn't go in with any expectations. I just wanted to see Captain Marvel. Overall these are my observations, and I enjoyed myself. I give it four stars for the theater being somewhat clean. I thought about comparing to tinseltown in pearl or the grand malco theater in Madison, but all these towns are a bit different in size.

Well when I received my order it looked nothing like shown on the menu the portion was very small it covered about maybe a quarter of the small tin plate it was served on. And I had to remind the servers that I had also ordered the load hash brown casserole. Well it wasn't load that's for sure under cooked potatoes with a little cheese again cracker barrel proves that there food is very mediocre.

63395,3,"I don't seem to have any luck with Cracker Barrel. I went to this location last weekend later at night. I ordered grilled trout with salad and baked potato. It took about an hour before our food and cornbread muffins arrived (we actually asked if we should pay for our drinks and leave), and they were out of baked potato and almost forgot my salad. I will give them some credit because it was late at night and because they were nice about it, but this wasn't my first bad experience at Cracker Barrel.

I remember several times that the food took a while to arrive and that some items were not available. I had lunch at a Shreveport, LA location in July 2012, which was my absolute worst experience at Cracker Barrel. In Shreveport, our food took about the same amount of time to arrive as it did in Tupelo, but we never got ANY cornbread muffins. In Shreveport, the baked apples had turnip greens mixed in them -- absolutely unacceptable.

In Tupelo, the problem seems to be in the kitchen staff, but in Shreveport, the kitchen and wait staff were at fault. The only reason I rated 3 stars was because the food is always good, hot, and fresh (when it finally does arrive), but good food should be matched with good service.",Cracker Barrel Old Country Store,"['American restaurant', 'Gift shop', 'Hobby store', 'Restaurant', 'Southern restaurant (US)']","Homey chain restaurant serving American comfort food, with an on-site general store.",1.1276341826300725e+20_1434523083839

The people were friendly as well, so I normally give some bonus points for that.  But everything coming out of the kitchen was subpar.  My wife ordered a sauce to go on her fish, which didnt come out with the rest of the food.  Until we got it, her food was cold.  My daughter asked for ranch, which we never received.  The expeditor didnt do their job at all and the quality just wasnt there.  If it wasnt for the biscuits, it would have been a total loss on the dinner.

63680,2,"So, to preface, as a child and teen in the 80's, Red Lobster was my favorite restaurant (the annual ""birthday pick"", as it were). Over the last 20 or so years, my experience has been far from rewarding. But, about once every 6 years or so, I decide to give Red Lobster another shot. First: the place had a musty odor to it as soon as you walk in the door. And what once could have been taken as dimly-lit ambience, now just comes off as a bit gloomy and serving to hide the dated and worn-out decor. The server was pleasant but robotic--just going through the motions. The food was no surprise--still the same, over-priced, tiny shrimp, scallops, clam strips, etc. that I've experienced in my last few visits. Honestly, I've gotten better food and ""bang for my buck"" at Captain D's.

64017,4,"When you walk in the restaurant from the gravel parking lot, you see a dining room that looks more like a barn with tables scattered around. It is full of honest charm and has a warm atmosphere even when its busy.

A few bites of the barbecue and you'll understand why there are often many out of state license plates in the parking lot; it's good. It's very good. The rib meat falls off the bone and is seasoned just right; it's dry enough to not make a mess, but wet enough to keep fans of wet ribs happy. The homemade sauce is a little on the sweet side and pairs very well with the meats.  You could drown the pulled pork in it but you'd be missing out on the wood flavor from the smoker in back.

The bbq baked beans are ridiculously good. My son is a super picky eater when it comes to baked beans; he scarfed these down with very little need for parental motivation. My wife loved the potato salad.

The server was the source of much joking. She declared that she didn't need to write down the orders, eidetic memory. We aren't sure what she photographed but certainly not our order for four. She would have been more accurate using the menu as a dart board and throwing darts in the dark.
Some of the order was correct,a miniscule part. Most of the order was a mess.
The ribs were overcooked and flavorless. Perhaps they're boiled?

I've been visiting Johnnie's for years and I love the place.
I usually order their famous dough burger, with cheese, fries, and a chocolate milkshake; they are excellent.  I also like their BBQ sandwich.

If you haven't been, you need to go visit them and place an order.  You can sit there and eat or take it with you.  Give them a try.  I think you'll enjoy it. They celebrated their 70th anniversary not long ago.. And, Elvis Presley ate there when he was a boy.  It is within walking distance from his  birthplace home. I

64338,4,"This place hasn't been open for very long, but with that being said, every experience I had shows that everyone there cares about what they are doing, and they do it very well.

I did not have a chance to try out every restaurant, but the Oasis Grill was quite nice. The food came out quickly, and was very good for the type of food it is.

The pool bar is one of my favorites things, and the drinks are also very good.

I can't stress enough how new this place is, as it still has that ""new"" smell.

The rooms are spacious and clean. The beds are comfortable, and the air conditioning works well. (Seems random to include this in a review, but here on the coast it is very important.)

The only reason I took a point off for now, at least, is that the water in the rooms can smell like sulfur. Which I am unsure if it is just their pipes, or the city of Gulfport's issue. After the shower and sink had been used some more it slowly got better but was still there. This leads me to believe it may just be part of it being so new.",Centennial Plaza,"['Resort hotel', 'Hotel', 'Park', 'Restaurant', 'Tourist attraction', 'Water park']","Elegant rooms, some with gulf views, in an upmarket hotel on the grounds of a casual resort.",1.150797578512736e+20_1567457824969

64462,5,This is a neat little restaurant in McComb. There are several huge round tables with a massive lazy susan in the middle. Each day has a different menu. You choose whatever dishes you want to eat. I have eaten there several times and the food has always been delicious. The fried eggplant and chicken are the best. The individual dishes of food are placed on the table in medium sized bowls and are replenished frequently. The food is never cold. Everyone at the table is friendly and lively conversations are the norm.

64499,1,"This Whataburger has problems. First, I'd caution you against you against ordering any drinks here. Recently, I went to dump out the remnants of ice from two Coca-Cola drinks we ordered here. I was shocked to see a black substance left in the cup. This looked like mold or some other grime that resulted from an unsanitary ice machine or fountain dispenser. It was definitely not leftover soda syrup. I reported this to Whataburger  customer care and no one bothered to contact me as is their customer service standard.

All of our recent orders have also arrived incomplete or wrong. I understand an occasional oversight. That is not the issue at this store. I spoke with the manager here after the last order issue and she assured me this was being addressed and would improve. I hope she is right, but after the food safety concern described above with their drinks, I have no interest in returning to give them another chance.

My sprite lacked that. I'm more willing to say that was good luck rather than good cleaning. Personally my order was correct but my brother's one lacked fries and was undercooked.

Then when we asked for our drinks we were told by the young lady she would get to it by when she could keep in mind the cups and drink michine was right next to her! When the order was brought out a 2nd young lady who was obviously upset that we were interfering with her FaceTime on her phone,place the tray on the table and push it towards us never saying a word and getting right back to her phone! Now the food,I have every certainty that I could do better in my own kitchen the ribs took dry to a whole nother level,the beans made Bush's look like they are blue ribbon champions of the world,the fries were stale,over cooked and I feel bad for the potatoes that were sacrificed,speaking of potatoes,the baked potato salad had bones in it and my wife nearly chipped her tooth not once but twice eating the few bites she did of it! The pictures of the food on there page were obviously taken from the internet! I will never go back,and I will make sure anytime anybody mentions BBQ to let them know that Old Style BBQ in Olive Branch MS horrible the only thing they got right when they named the business was the word OLD!

Unfortunately, the food isn't matched by the service. It often takes several minutes to be acknowledged by a server after being seated by the hostesses, then there's another wait to have your drink order taken.  The servers aren't given too many tables; as a former restaurant manager, I just can't fathom what the servers are doing to kill so much time in the alley while fresh tables are looking around for any signs of service.

You order, you get a ""table tent"" with a number on it and a staff member knows where to bring the food.
The food has never disappointed me. It's always just how I ordered it and tastes great every time.",Whataburger,"['Restaurant', 'Breakfast restaurant', 'Chicken restaurant', 'Fast food restaurant', 'Hamburger restaurant', 'Takeout Restaurant']","Circa-1950 fast-food chain for counter-serve burgers, some stacked with multiple patties.",1.1029245116754643e+20_1573426882046

Currently, only some pillars holding the outer facade of the erstwhile mansion remain standing. The exposure to the elements ensure a steady rate of erosion and decay. Nevertheless, the remote location, the rusted, splintered ironwork and the defiant ruins of the pillars behind a protective fence are sure to transport you back a few centuries.

Prime rib has to be my favorite here however it's only available on the weekends if I don't get that I'd recommend the country fried steak with cream gravy or the hammer steak ribeye those all seem to come out of that kitchen very good.

66304,1,Maybe one of the worst restaurants that I have visited. Saturday waited 30 minutes to be seated and after placing the order 45 minutes to receive my food not only that when the food was brought out it was lukewarm had to send it back. Then today March 13th 2018 when back to support Elementary School for a fundraiser I was seated soon as I walk in then the order was placed and receive my order over an hour later. One of the people I was with ordered a hamburger and they had ran out of buns so the manager came out and asked what they like it on Texas toast since they ran out of buns. And when it came out it was on two pieces of white bread. Also the burger was not done as specified didn't want mushrooms on it then want onions on it and didn't want tomatoes on it but lo and behold it had mushrooms bacon lettuce tomatoes onions on White Bread. Also they never received their loaded fries. I ordered chicken strips because of what I ordered the previous Saturday was lukewarm and wasn't good at all so I tried something simple just to help support the school and didn't receive all of my order. So the manager came out and ask what can she do to make it right I said absolutely nothing you yourself specifically said that it would be on Texas toast and it came out on two pieces and it came out on two pieces of white bread really after we have waited for over an hour for some food and you want to try to make it right there is nothing you can do. and started calling to the back to see if somebody had went out and bought some buns it's too late for all that. I would never go there again and I don't see what the big fuss is because they stay crowded. The first time okay they will crowd it so I can kind of understand that but bringing out pretty much cold food that's crazy. And then go back a second time what are not as crowded and have to wait over an hour for some food I would not recommend this place to anyone.,Texas Roadhouse,"['Steak house', 'American restaurant', 'New American restaurant']",Lively chain steakhouse serving American fare with a Southwestern spin amid Texas-themed decor.,1.0574170681626042e+20_1521000119479

Another ten minutes later, our waiter returned to tell me they were out of the item I ordered.  I chose something else.  A half hour later, when it showed up, I asked for it to go.

66420,2,"One stsr for edible, and one for no one got sick. The service and the quality of food left much to be desired. I rarely figure out what i want before drinks are delivered, so to figure out drinks, appetizers, and meals before the waiter shows up to ask about drinks is sad. Just that would be forgivable, but when drinks sit empty long enough that I start contemplating going and refilling them myself, NOPE! My medium rare t-bone was wonderful on the filet side, and grey well done on the strip somehow. Her filet was as ordered, but the sweet potato was burned, and both our shrimp were overcooked, rubbery, and had a crust flaking off the sides from the ""grilling"".

This was our second attempt at this location, so not a one off. Sadly, the poor service this time came from a waiter who, by the shirt he was wearing, IS THE TRAINER FOR THIS LOCATION. Other waitstaff tending surrounding tables seemed  more competent and attentive, so maybe its a ""those who can't, train"" scenario. Either way, from here on out, we will drive the 40 minutes further to enjoy the Slidell, LA location.

67363,1,"I was totally disappointed with the food i received from Whataburger early this morning. I ordered a double avocado bacon burger Lg size with a Dr Pepper (for my husband) a Breakfast plate bacon meal with a Dt. Coke 1 extra order of hash browns sticks and a side of sausage to go in my meal. Now my Husband had no complaints except he would have preferred the very stong onion on his burger sauteed. I myself couldn't eat anything in my meal except for the hash browns sticks (which is 4 small 2 bite sticks). Thankfully I ordered the extra order of them because if not I would have only had 4 small hash browns sticks instead of 8 of them to try to fill my belly. The scrambled eggs had so much salt in them you'd think they dumped an entire salt shaker on them. Now to be fair I am not a salt eater. So I asked my husband to try them and see if it was just me. Nope not just me, my husband a salt lover spit them out and said that's just horrible. The biscuit, so hard i could have chipped a hockey players tooth with it. Bacon, just awful. I love bacon and couldn't force myself to eat it. As for the side of sausage, no go there either. Looked like a childs fake food for the play kitchens they make. And was as rubbery as it looked. I would have been embarrassed to serve that to any customer. I dont want a replacement meal, and totally lost my appetite. Not to mention it has ruined Whataburger for me forever. I will however be returning to ask for a refund today and express my dissatisfaction with the Store Manager. I will not ever eat there again.

That's how this Whatsburger is too. I am really tire of going to fast food joints and the employees just acts like they are miserable and want to make sure you are too. I will go out of my way to patronize a good fast food place if the service is nice. Thank you to all at Whatsburger for being so professional!,Whataburger,"['Restaurant', 'Breakfast restaurant', 'Chicken restaurant', 'Fast food restaurant', 'Hamburger restaurant', 'Takeout Restaurant']","Circa-1950 fast-food chain for counter-serve burgers, some stacked with multiple patties.",1.1120997700254638e+20_1544490688897

Since that day, I have called to check to see if the ingredients for a Caramel Ribbon Crunch had come in on the truck. The person that answered the phone today ASSURED me that the proper ingredients had come in. I exited off the interstate (and my original route) to proceed to Starbucks. After waiting in the LONG line, I get to the speaker to place my order. I attempted to order a Ham and Swiss Croissant and a Caramel Ribbon Crunch (that I was told was in fact available). Neither of the items were available, not even the one that I was told on the phone was available. Stacey in the Drive Thru window was EXTREMELY RUDE about this situation.

The bathrooms are always clean. There is actually plenty of parking despite a previous review. Starbucks is located next to a furniture store so there is shared parking. There is another parking lot adjacent to Starbucks parking that is huge. Very easy parking for larger vehicles or parking for busy days. I visit this location at least once a week.

The salad was old with brown on the lettuce. The Mac n cheese reminded me of Kraft mac and cheese a child would eat,. The lobster and shrimp was like chewing on rubber. Over all the food is bland , or over salted.  I don't like this location and the  wait time is forever. I had a get together with my group of friends and we waited over an hour for our food. The servers did not bother to come around for water or biscuits.  I really felt disrespected the last time I went there with my husband, we waited an hour for our food and we had 10 mins to eat because they were closing.

68522,3,"Everyone in Jackson raves about Primo's -- and, as local breakfasts go, it's more than adequate. It's been around forever, but its current incarnation on Lakeland Drive is a little over a decade old.

You'll find all the regular breakfast items here, and they're all perfectly acceptable. My problem with Primo's? The food could be so much more, but stops shy of being remarkable. There's a blandness here, a sameness, best expressed by the breakfast burrito. It's served without salsa and lacks any spiciness at all -- and that's a shame, because just a little seasoning could go a long way with this dish.

And that sets the tone for the rest of the offerings, as well. Pretty good pancakes. Acceptable eggs. So-so bacon. You get the idea.

You won't be disappointed, but you won't be thrilled. Meantime, you could do much worse -- so tuck in and make the best of it.",Primos Cafe,['Family restaurant'],Longtime casual restaurant serving Southern American fare in diner-like digs with bakery counter.,1.0016544456240325e+20_1479587596116

68712,3,"While it beats yet another meal from a chain, this Meridian buffet -- very, very popular with locals who were born during the Great Depression -- is average at very best.

Fried chicken is hard to get wrong, but there's something about the paper-thin batter here that just didn't work on either the bone-in pieces or the boneless chicken fingers. It's not quite tempura batter, and not quite your Southern mama's brown and crispy batter; instead, it's thin and papery and quite greasy.

Vegetables and other sides seem to have been seasoned primarily with sugar, with the exception of the greens, which we found too bitter to eat.

We love and grew up with Southern cooking, but this earnest little spot ain't serving up what you remember from Mama's kitchen -- unless your mama was a very mediocre cook indeed. Note that, while the buffet is all you can eat, the dessert bar (literally, a bar littered with desserts on paper plates) is ""one visit per customer,"" so be sure to pick a winner to start with.

I arrived spoke with a young girl at the register that called back on a phone and advised I was there for my order. 15 minutes later a young guy came up to me and asked if I was waiting on a Togo order and advised he would check on it. He came back and said they are starting on it. I assumed they were starting on bagging it for me. He then told the young lady when she calls it back she needs to almost yell it in the intercom, I knew at this point they didn't even know I was there prior to this but still assumed they had the meal cooked and waiting in a warmer or something. 10 more minutes pass and they go to check again and finally came out with my meal 55 minutes after I placed my order of pancakes. No apology from the lady that brought it out and no apology when they didn't have everything in the bag either so all in all it too a full hour to get pancakes Togo and no manager was ever notified the young lady just kept saying how busy they were when there was maybe 15 cars out front and no wait.

69456,5,"I got off work early, was seated promptly by my server, and ordered a house margarita on happy hour special. I drank that as I waited for my boyfriend.  The servers (I think they are called entertainers in breastaurants.) Were wearing underwear and their hair was down where it could easily get into food. I've work in food and drink service for many years and at no place I've ever worked, would the health department allow that. Although I've heard from industry friends, that the rules are different for such establishments.
My gentleman friend arrived and we ordered the quesadillas which were also on a happy hour special. Our quesadillas arrived promptly and we ordered a couple more margaritas.  Everything was great except there were no limes in our subsequent margaritas and our server didn't prebus the table. I realize the limes are the bartender's fault for not cutting them.  But I've always been trained to get stuff off the table as the patrons finish. I understand that she wasn't trained as a server and she was very nice. Knowing what to expect,  I would return.

69524,5,"I've been here a handful of times. The waitresses are nearly naked so if that bothers you i suggest you dont go and be forewarned if you have children. I started out by ordering two liquid marijuanas. For some reason every restaurant I go to makes these differently. The drinks were ok, the 1st one was good but the 2nd one was watered down. I also ordered the fried shrimp plate and it came with fries. The shrimp were very huge and they were fried and seasoned perfectly. We also had an order of their hot wings. They were not fresh at all. And they were not fried hard like we asked. They actually seemed precooked to me. They seemed like the frozen wings instead of fresh cooked and coated wings that I prefer. The wings we ordered only came with dipping sauce and celery sticks. I expected at least to get a side order of fries, baked potato or vegetables but that was not the case. On our most recent visit our waitress never checked back with us for refills, napkins or to remove any unnecessary clutter from our table. I still tipped her but it was a special night and she kind of made the experience just a little worse. To all the waitresses and waiters out there just know that lousy service can and have ruined many special occasions for customers.",Twin Peaks Restaurant,"['American restaurant', 'Bar & grill', 'Chicken wings restaurant', 'Hamburger restaurant', 'Sports bar']",Sports-bar chain where scantily clad waitresses serve American comfort food in lodgelike surrounds.,1.1124905783192429e+20_1550484621657

But they also have some really good house beers named appropriately for their male dominated clientele even down to the size selections being between getting a man sized beer or a girl sized beer.   Looking passed any sexist aspects as a detractor, I also couldn't give this 5 stars as the food here is inconsistent in quality.

I had previously given this restaurant 5 stars but during the quarantine this quickly changed. I ordered food curbside online and when I got to the restaurant I was told that it is no longer will bring food out...even though I paid for that service. I explained i had a compromised immune system and didnt want to risk it but that did not matter to them. When I went in it was overcrowded and not one standard of distancing was being observed or any face coverings being used. I had to wait 30 minuets before them to bring me my food after having placed the order 45 minuets prior. I complained and was told I would be refunded for my service....which never happened! I emailed corporate and still received no answer or refund after being told it would be done. I had an associate who went a few weeks later and said things had changed with social distancing protocols but that does not change my experience with them.
