It is one of the most remote beaches on the island and is never crowded. You need a car to get here since the City Bus only goes up to Makaha Beach. The beach gets pounded by high surf during the winter months. This is the time when many locals and visiting surfers come here to experience the thrills of the churning white water. We went in April but the waves and currents were still very strong. Lifeguards  are present most of the time and for good reason. The rocky ocean bottom, strong currents and high waves can be dangerous especially for beginning surfers. Yokohama Bay has fine soft sand and is backed by the Wai'nae Mountain Range.

Their food was well priced for the quality, with a quantity that more than satisfied.

20612,5,"Friends recently took me to Bravos. First off, we were welcomed with bright smiles and friendly faces. Then we were served with the same exact enthusiasm. My fiance and I had never been there before, so we looked over the menu. We were not that hungry so we ordered drinks and the mozzarella sticks. The complimentary bread was so dang yummy, I could have probably just eaten that for dinner, but I'm glad I didnt because the mozzarella sticks, were not sticks. They were actually patties of some kind. They were the best mozzarella appetizers I have ever had!!!! The drinks were constantly being refilled without us having to ask.
We will absolutely be back when we are hungry. Cant wait to try the veggie lasagna. I heard it's awesome. Service was amazing, and the restaurant is very clean and organized!!!

They have a full service bar and you can eat there as well. This place is always crowded around dinner time. I like the chicken fettuccine as it's my favorite there. Pick any type of pasta with any type of sauce and meats or vegetarian style. The service is fast and you usually can't finish your salad before your main dish arrives. And when it arrives, it arrives very hot. Leave room for their delicious desserts. I usually eat too much food so I eat the sorbet dessert which reduces the bloat feeling. The prices are very reasonable for what you get. Lots of seating but again the place fills up. Even though the wait isn't that long.

20717,3,"I remain perplexed as to why this place is so very busy all the time. It's fun for groups, and the food is fine but basic. There are a lack of Italian restaurants on the island, but I don't know if you could really call what they serve here Italian. It's mostly American fare, heavy on the pasta. It's got a little something for everyone, which is probably part of what makes it so popular. I'm just not sure. If Olive Garden were ever to come to Hawaii, I'm pretty sure they would clear this place out. But until then, this is it.

They serve free garlic balls, which are really small Garlic Knot rolls. Oily. Garlicky. But yeah, mostly just really oily.

Unusually angled bathrooms.

Accepts credit cards.

High chairs available.

Parking is free, but very very tight. Lot is shared with Anna Miller's Restaurant, Starbucks, Jamba Juice,  and a bunch of other shops. Be careful when parking, as people will shoot in from any side of the lane. Handicapped parking is oddly located, down at the very front, driving around the restaurant.

Unless you have reservations, and sometimes even if you do have reservations, be prepared to wait. There is banquette seating inside for waiting, or you can wait outside on some of the high curbs.",Bravo Italian Restaurant,"['Italian restaurant', 'Restaurant']",Laid-back trattoria featuring a variety of Italian favorites including complimentary garlic rolls.,1.025263459229875e+20_1485501370109

Parking is plentiful, though you may have to try the lot closer to the mall. It's consistently busy, with a few (under 4) people there can be a 15 minute wait or so pau hana time.

The service is excellent and most all dishes can be made extra spicy. The pizza is good, french fries okay, drinks a bit pricey. This is one of the few places I've found that will make my dishes really hot , so I usually order dishes really hot - yes, sometimes at the dish's expenses.

The dough balls are excellent, so much that it's worth a trip here alone for!

The dining area has ambience with courtyard like seating as well as bar seating inside.  Service was alittle uneven because different staff dropped by but I did not really have anyone taking care of me.

I had the pork dish which was good as was the price reasonable, but it did not fall in the fine dining category.  The dish was infused with honey but the overall taste was not very nuanced - it tasted like a barbecue rib with some added sugar.

The only thing I wish was that the servers actually ask which heat we preferred, as all the curries were way way way too mild for our palates. I suspect that our pale skins might have misled our servers and they just assumed we couldn't handle it.",Siam Square,['Thai restaurant'],"A wide range of traditional Thai fare is served in quiet, welcoming environs.",1.128054620099252e+20_1450554056214

They were they standard frozen kind from a food service vendor. The sauce was good so it helped. Next I ordered the ravioli with meat sauce and the wife ordered a shrimp and pasta dish. Both were good, the portions were good ( small ) the flavors we're also good. The meat sauce wasn't to sweet but could've had a touch more seasoning.

21161,4,"went for lunch with some co-workers. everyone's food looked pretty delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed mine

have to give it only four star cause of what happened to a co-worker. had an incident with a co-workers food.  found a single strand of hair but they quickly offered to replace it when they found out. these things happen so I don't think it's worth making a huge scene.

but it was one of those awkward times where you just wish they would comp it.  if the person discovers something and already ate over a third of it, it's highly unlikely that they want to eat it again. PTSD man

but the meal was still on the bill... at least they offered to make her a new one to go and threw in dessert to go. I don't think situation was a terribly handled one, but it could have been better. as patrons, we didn't demand anything. but hopefully one day, restaurants understand where we are coming from and we're not trying to be cheap.

anyways, i'm still giving them four stars so hopefully paints the picture that the food was still good. just slightly disappointed how my co-workers situation was handled.",Paesano Ristorante Italiano,"['Italian restaurant', 'Restaurant']",Hearty portions of Italian fare with Asian influence served in a white-tablecloth setting.,1.0882631123896635e+20_1469203443415

21206,2,"Tldr:  It's almost as good as you'll find on the island and no better or worse than Jose's. They both have their, um, charms.

The chips were passable, light, fresh, not greasy but served in 4 oz baskets, with small amounts of blended salsa and slow on the refills. Guacamole was large chunks of avocado, good, but not guac. Rice tasted like plain boiled, with not much more color. Salsa and sauces were all mild and the only peppers were Thai chilis, with not a serrano, jalapeno or habanero to be had.

Carnitas were a few slices of thick, well seared and good pork, but none of the seasoning that makes carnitas right. Veggie chimichanga was not  good as those, you might have a little better luck with the pork tamales but save the buck fifty on the mole unless you love canned. It might be made there but it's tough to tell.

21446,2,"We went at 2 PM and there were only a couple of booths occupied but we passed four uncleared tables before being seated at a window booth. The views from the many windowside booths are excellent. The waitress came quickly and we ordered chicken bruschetta and the spicy skillet. The chicken was ok but the whole grain rice side was positively crispy and chewy. When the waitress asked, I advised her that it seemed to have been scraped from the bottom of the pan. She assured me the portions were microwaved in prepackaged units. (!)She did offer to replace it but I had lost interest at that point. The mango smoothie is just OK. I noticed no other waitresses so this may explain all the dirty tables. My husband asked for a plate when the skillet dinner came but the waitress forgot for quite a while and never refilled his water glass. My sister has lived in Kona for 25 years and says everyone knows not to eat at this restaurant. One good thing... the prices are reasonable.

When we got the food home, they still got the order wrong. Upon calling the restaurant we told them of the error and asked if we could bring the untouched order back (so they didn't think we were trying to scam them) and get the correct order. After some back and forth over the phone, they said ""well what do you want us to do?"" to which we said ""right your wrong"". They refused, so we just hung up.

But this was not the case at the Wailea location. First, we were not told that there was a recall on lettuce until ordering, instead they only had one alternative for the early bird special which was not to our taste. It would have much better to communicate that at reservation and perhaps creating more alternative options. I know they can't control the recall but the lack of communication was disappointing.  Second, the whole restaurant seemed a bit outdated from the decor to the stained cutlery, plates and other dishes. Third, our steaks were overcooked from what we ordered.

I was visiting with a party of adults and children, and the kids' meals were every bit as well prepared as the adults' (no fish sticks or hot dogs here!).

The only disappointment was the cocktails.  To be fair, RCS doesn't list cocktails on their menu, and we may have had unreasonable expectations about what we would receive, but I would much prefer to be told that a drink was unavailable than to have a bad drink.  The ones ordered by our party seemed to be a slap-dash job - they didn't seem to be mixed properly and it seemed that ""substantial liberties"" were taken with the recipes.  Most unfortunately, the drinks were all heavily iced and quickly became watered down.

While the cocktails were disappointing, I really want to emphasize that the rest of the meal was phenomenally delicious and the service was really wonderful.  I would happily go back here and know that I could have an excellent meal with any group.

It took a good 20 minutes to get our food and we were the only customers there at the time, not a big deal just seemed a little abnormal.  The real issues are one burger had a hair on it (took it back they made another right away), ordered a makena burger and they didn't put the pineapple, and all of our burgers were overcooked.  The fries and chicken tenders were decent but nothing mind blowing.  I expected this to be the cool cats of Kihei but came away disappointed.

We also went here for dinner. We told our waiter, John, that we had Dairy and Gluten allergies. Chef RJ made us a special 4 course meal in full consideration of our allergies. They even made us custom desserts to finish off the meal. The food and the service was amazing.

21928,5,"This gem of a restaurant is an absolute MUST see if you are interested in getting some amazing food with a view. If you're a foodie, you're going to love the centralized station for the kitchen in the middle of the dining room, where guests can reserve chef's table seating and watch as the chefs do their thing. Or if you'd prefer some fresh air and a view for your dining experience, reserve a spot out on the lanai and enjoy a beautiful sunset above the infinity pools.
The real prize of this restaurant isn't just the ambience though, it's the food. This place has taken the prize as my new favorite place on Maui. During my last visit with my partner, we had the watermelon salad, which was very light and refreshing start to the meal after a long day at the beach. We then had the Ahi Bigeye and the Scallop Risotto for our main dishes, and the food was exceptional. The Ahi dish was so flavorful, and the bacon jam was a perfect touch. The scallops were also perfectly cooked, and the risotto was a creamy blend with mushrooms and a delicious sauce.
Additionally, the menu makes it obvious through the use of a small flower design which dishes are of an entree size, and which are of a smaller, more appetizer size, so guests need not worry if their dish will be too small to fill them up! Attention to small details, from the presentation of the food, to the use of the space, to thinking about the appetites of their guests ahead of time, really make this place stand out to me. I will absolutely be visiting again.

2. Food is fresh. Farm to table.

3. Salmon especially is my favorite, fruit fresh, and served ripened.

4. Excellent array of cheeses.

5. Green juice a must. Perfectly blended. Coffee fresh and always promptly served, bottomless.

6.  Miso, could use a little more flavoring. But broth is freshly made, tofu soft and lots of seaweed.

7.  Hot sauces, goes great with eggs. Jalapeno lime sauce is the mild, pineapple is medium, and smoked scorpion is the fire.

8.  Bacon applewood, crispy, flavorful. Sausages, good variations; Portuguese, pork, and smoked.

9.  Mochi waffles, perfectly cooked. Lilikoi curd tops it.

At first, they looked good, but then my wife noticed that her chicken was RAW. Yes, totally RAW in the middle. Cold and pink. And my wife had already taken a bite of it.

They were apologetic brought us a new one, but that's tough to get over.  Ultimately, the server, who was fantastic, did comp us the sesame noodles for our trouble, which was nice. But I wondered if it would have been more fair if they comped us the chicken, which was twice as expensive.

22009,1,"We were disappointed by the service and food rendered and served to us earlier today at lunchtime. First of all, we had to wait at least 20 minutes to be seated, because of servers shortage.  Secondly, when we were seated we waited at least 10 minutes before the waiter took our  orders. Thirdly, the lumpiang ubod I ordered was out of stock or sold out, l was craving for lumpiang ubod that's why I came to this restaurant today. Fourthly, the pork sisig we ordered was very salty, so we told the waiter it was salty then he took the plate and said that he will replace it. While waiting for the sisig , we paused eating the rest of our orders.  However, 10-15 minutes had passed and no pork sisig yet. So we asked the waiter where is our sisig, and he said I thought it was canceled, then after saying that he rushed back ti the kitchen for our sisig replacement. He came back quickly to our table with the sisig, but I told my companion that I will taste it first making sure I's not salty anymore.  Upon testing the dish, the saltiness was fixed but this time it's very spicy. Too much jalapenos. We notified the waiter again, and once again he said he'll just cancel the sisig order.
Also, the prices of the foods are too pricey for the amount of portions served. Too stingy.","Max's Restaurant, Cuisine of the Philippines, Dillingham","['Filipino restaurant', 'Asian restaurant', 'Banquet hall', 'Chicken restaurant', 'Restaurant', 'Southeast Asian restaurant']",Filipino restaurant chain popular for its fried chicken served with banana ketchup.,1.1790164943540191e+20_1559388363226

My family ordered a lot: garlic rice and steamed rice, palabok, whole fried chicken, sinigang, sizzling tofu, and fresh lumpia.  The chicken and the sizzling tofu were the best out of all the dishes.  The chicken was moist, and had a crispy skin.  The sizzling tofu was reminiscent of honey walnut shrimp.  It was slightly sweet because of the mayonnaise, but a bit spice from the jalapeno.

The fresh lumpia and palabok were okay.  There wasn't much flavor in both dishes.

Service was a bit slow for my taste.  We had to keep on flagging down a waiter.  But the staff was friendly and we always had our water glasses filled.","Max's Restaurant, Cuisine of the Philippines, Dillingham","['Filipino restaurant', 'Asian restaurant', 'Banquet hall', 'Chicken restaurant', 'Restaurant', 'Southeast Asian restaurant']",Filipino restaurant chain popular for its fried chicken served with banana ketchup.,1.0351408562035245e+20_1436591618330

My sandwich was hot but my hash browns tasted like they had just been microwaved. When we went to the counter to finally pay, we had to wait another 10 minutes because the cashier was talking to people at a table instead of doing her job.

Didn't even get a refill until we asked for the check. As if she wanted to make up for such crummy service. What was even worse was when our food was brought she didn't even bother to give us utensils. We waited and waited and waited. I had to get up go the the register and wait more!!! So I just took it upon myself to grab my own utensils. Will never return.

The waiters, and especially the waitresses have zero training on how to treat a customer, and apparently don't care to change. Our waitress was an older Filipino lady that had the worst attitude. She seemed annoyed to take our order, gave us our food 30 minutes later, never came to check on us or fill our empty water, then SLAMMED our check on the table. Other times, we just walked out because the people at the front desk don't bother to do their job. They're usually found talking story with someone, ignoring all the people that need to be seated.

22200,2,"I'm not sure if we arrived there during a shift change. But we arrived at may 2:30pm. There was hardly anyone there. We used the restroom before sitting. The gentlemen showed us where to sit. But didnt put menu's on table as well as silverware.
So after the restroom we sat where we were pointed to. But had to wait 5-10 min. Before someone who was leaving called someone from the back.
Further more we placed our orders. Our waitress was polite and apologized. But when our greens salad came. There was some nasty lettuce that I took out. Cause I really wanted a salad.
When my main dish came it wasn't how I asked my T-bone steak to be. I asked for medium Rare n got cooked no blood what so ever. I let it slide since the easy over eggs hash n toast was making up for it I guess. Lmsao.
Then our waitress advised us it was OK to take our time. But had to pick her son up from school. But also said another lady will check on us while we were out. Um nope no one did. So by the time she came back more of our family arrived and we were talking stories. And she was nice enough to ask if they would like to have something as well. We declined.

I'm sorry I forget our waitresses name. But she was the best worker there. Made sure she got the tip. I just hope she didnt have to share it. I'm not sure if she is a single mom but she handled herself well. She can also multi task well. She made sure her son was OK, as well as to see if her other customers were as well. Thank you.

You get lime, NOT lemon with your pho, the broth is well-balanced in flavor and not too salty, whatever beef you order is always tasty. Don't stop there, try their crispy and flavorful spring rolls, rice vermicelli bowls, oxtail soup and pad thai, just to name a few. I appreciate how perfectly seasoned their pad thai always is, with just the right balance of ingredients. The sauce doesn't taste ketchup based. I like to order the chicken and tofu pad thai. Usually when you order this at other places, the chicken is dry, overcooked, flavorless and the tofu is pretty much the same. Here they manage to cook both chicken and tofu that is tender, juicy, and well-infused with flavor. Service is excellent, prices are reasonable.

I had grilled fish tacos, crunchy beef taco and shrimp tacos on different occasions and they were meh. They give you a small side of chips and I mean small. It's too pricey for one taco and a small thing of chips. There world famous salsa bar lacks flavor. I was excited to try the pineapple salsa since I never had it before  and I tried it twice and both times no flavor. One thing I did like was the banana chingling. It's a banana wrapped it dough and friend with ice cream. So good.

One thing I was impressed with was that they had a pretty decent vegan option. They could do better by offering more vegan options but I must say, that the Waipio Taro Enchiladas were fantastic! They also offered a coconut based vegan ice cream which is made right here on the Big Island in Hilo. Hawaiian Licks vegan frozen desserts are amazing. So if you want great food, with a nice ambiance give Merriman's a try. I would have given them 5 stars if they had an expanded plant based menu.

Skip the overpriced resort breakfast and treat yourself to an early lunch at Merriman's and you might actually be saving money!

I love misoyaki butterfish and Roy's does it perfectly!  Would I like to pay less?  Sure, but if you want it done right where the flavors are well balanced (not too salty, sweet nor sour), the fish texture is perfectly tender, the bones are completely cleaned out, and they add a light bed of black rice and sweet potato and wasabi sauce to decorate and supplement the flavors beside the main, then the price is right (it's actually a bargain if you consider their consistency and precision). I went there for dinner and they were busy and I could hear some of the chaos.  But, I was not in a rush and from sit down to departure was 1.5 hours.  So, Roy's is still the top of the charts for great food, great drinks, good service (be sure you're not in any hurry), good decor, and great place for a date, with good company or just for one.

The only thing is the spicy tuna was a little too mayo-based, so we actually wound up mixing some of the shoyu poke into the spicy tuna poke, and it was really good.

We came here for breakfast in a Sunday around  11 am. It was pretty full but we got seated quickly. They have a huge seating area!
I ordered the full Aussie breakfast but without any bacon or sausage. The server offered to substitute haloumi cheese instead. I really enjoyed the food! The eggs ofcourse needed salt and pepper but the tomatoes were so delicious! I don't usually like tomatoes in a discernable tomato form but these were so good! Hubby got the ricotta hotcakes which he really liked and so did I! They had this caramel on the plate which was delicious with the pancakes! I guess the ricotta is in the pancake mix because it's not on them. Very good nevertheless! I did really want to try the corn fritters! Wish they had an option for one or two as sides!

Anyways he walked away shaking his head I was a little furious at this time so I decided to follow him and put him on video to let him know that we bought something already and why he kept asking for me to leave.

RESTAURANT:

Alan Wong's is in a surprising location.  It is on the third floor of what seems like a small office building.  However, the restaurant is very nice inside.

SERVICE:

The service is some of the best on the island.  I rarely could take two sips of water without my glass being refilled!

FOOD:

We ordered the whole tomato salad, Kauai shrimp ""escargot style,"" da bag, seared day boat scallops risotto, and the coconut.  The tomato salad is one of my favorite tomato salads, anywhere!  The escargot style is a unique way to eat shrimp.  Da bag arrives at the table as puffed up tin foil over the bowl.  The server then opens the tin foil to release the steam and expose the clams and kalua pig.  The coconut presentation is beautiful and the dish itself is extremely refreshing.

23646,2,"Unfortunately one of the more unfortunate high end restaurants I have been to.  Seems like a fancy restaurant that overcharges, and tries to have a michelin star but far from achieving one.

Service: waiter and waitresses forgot about us, we actually heard ""ahhh"" and saw a waiter turn the other direction because he forgot about our food (we had asked about long wait). For a 5 course tasting menu, it took nearly 3 hours. It normally takes a 7-9 course tasting menu for me to make it last 3 hours. It was also to celebrate a birthday and engagement. The names on the plate were incorrect for our dessert.

Food: good, but not amazing. Two of the five dishes were tasty. Foie gras kahlue pork grilled cheese with tomato soup (though the soup was a bit salty), and the twice cooked slow braised ribs. The signature sauce for the fish dish was also good, but the fish was very meteocre. My lobster and shrimp lasagne was unpleasant as well - both my mother and I had pasta that was incredibly undercooked.

Price: for the price, I'd think quality and service of food would be better.

I kept requesting bread.  Then the waiter says to me:  ""You've already had over 10 rolls.  Maybe 12.""  I asked:  Is there a limit?

23700,4,"Been here twice before, (every time) we visit Honolulu.
This visit was disappointing.
Other Patrons have voiced their displeasure, you would expect more from ""A Famed"" Restaurant such as this, perhaps Mr. Wong is someplace else and has allowed this to be managed by someone else.
A bottle of wine should be served at a proper temperature right. When the wine was poured for tasting the glass frosted over. It was a Cabernet Sauvignon 2012. Upon asking the ""Somm"" if he thought it might be a good idea to decant it to allow it to breath and hopefully encourage it to warm to a reasonable drinking temperature he said oh no it'll be fine in a few minutes. we had an hour and a half for dinner (another disappointment). After 25 minutes we haven't touched the wine, the glass remains frosted, so I insisted on a decanter to move things along.
We ordered  two small plates to which they said they could produce without onions, since when is a Poke not made from scratch, I had it last year same place and it was not a problem. Same thing with dinner plates, I had to select out of a small menu the least thing I wanted because they could not accommodate no onion request. I'm a reasonable person, I know somethings you simply can not remove or make without onions. I had to settle for something simple and not exactly satisfying.
Maybe it was just this night, but for me I'm only there twice a year and I won't waste my time going there again. There are other places to dine at that do cater to my likes.  Le Mer, Morimoto Asia, Hoku's at the Kahala Resort had absolutely no problem preparing, adjusting to no onions.",Alan Wong's Honolulu,"['Pacific Rim restaurant', 'Fine dining restaurant', 'Hawaiian restaurant', 'Restaurant']","Famed chef Alan Wong presents his innovative, colorful Hawaiian fare in an upscale, 3rd-floor space.",1.1454021864925538e+20_1541730284093

A bit of crunchy onions adds texture and flavor nuances to this appetizer. The Caesar salad was perfectly dressed (not over-salty--been eating low sodium) with fresh cheese shavings. Everyone has different palate, so it's relevant for you to know I use minimal dressing on my salads but I liked this one dressed.

24217,5,"This little hideaway just off the beach in Ka'anapali is a not so carefully guarded secret. Locals and longtime visitors think of it as a little piece of post-modern Maui -- a reminder of the early days before every inch of West Maui was covered with sprawling condos, timeshares and major hotels.

Nestled within the grounds of the Aston Maui Ka'anapali Villas, the Castaway Cafe is my favorite West Maui breakfast spot. They have something for everyone: loco moco for the locals, huevos rancheros, a wonderful benedict, great omlettes, traditional meal and egg dishes -- some with an island flair and  a variety of island-style pancakes involving some combination of fresh fruit, macadamia nuts and local syrups.

This is also a favorite after-hours watering hole for knowledgeable locals.

Tried the spicy shrimp.  The spieces are all there, perhaps a bit overly salted and a bit oiled  in terms of final outcome.  The shrimps are tasty, yes, but overly powered by the sauces that's heavy on salt.

The dish comes with a couple of scoops of rice and some side salad.

The food is 4 stars but the truck operator here actually offers fresh running water for hand washing and soap and towels...which I'll bump it up to 5 stars for the extra amenity not commonly found at a truck.

I just think that if you order a drink and food, the food should come out first. It was like we waited for more than five minutes for anybody to even greet us and then we were seated. We had our order taken and then we didn't see our server again until she brought the food out.

24797,5,Colleen's is a real success story in Haiku.

24967,5,"I am amazed astounded and cannot comprehend the level of high-quality service that I received at Chanel Ala Moana. From the moment that I entered the store until a transaction took the service was excellent. They listened to what I had to say and provided me options for exactly what I asked for. They are perfect examples of social distancing and availability of hand sanitizer. It is perhaps unfair to mention names because EVERY person in the boutique must and should be recognized for excellent service. Even after the transaction was complete they took an equal amount of time to make sure the purchase was beautifully wrapped fit for presentation to royalty. Even as I was about to depart they wisely  shared with me new fragrances released on Saturday August 15th. I highly recommend you take time for indulgence in yourself. Take time to treat someone regardless if it's you or a loved one something wonderful from this boutique. Go there and indulge yourself. You deserve that. Stay safe. Aloha. Douglas

Usually when I walk into Chanel looking like I did, no one offers to help me unless I ask and even then they usually reluctantly help me or not so nicely tell me I probably can't afford it.

She not only made me feel comfortable but also went out of her way to look for a limited run bag I've been looking for everywhere in NYC.

And, we ordered ultimate combo and it's enough for two of us, the price is fair. My husband loves their red sauce and I love the black sauce! The white sauce is just okay in our opinion. Despite of the good sauce to make the crab legs flavorful and tasty, they overcooked the shrimps. The shrimps lost its fresh taste and were just cooked too long.

We were thinking that with the price in the menu, we would be eating something special. Instead the crabs we ate are thin and without any meat.

We were so disappointed. We could barely hear the cracking fresh sound crab shells usually emits when you crack open it.

It is not worth the money we paid for the meal. With that in mind, it is as if we were paying for an expensive crab cracker we got as souvenir instead of enjoying a delicious crab meal.

The sauces were great though the basic butter sauce is a little plain for my taste but others at our table liked it a lot. Dessert was limited to 2 choices. Both are malasadas. While a little heavier than malasadas from Hawaii they are still good. And our group loved the stuffed malasada which I never had before.

25059,1,I have been to several resteraunts of this style. Sadly the service and the food at this particular one left a lot to be desired. We were seated quickly it was about 8pm on a weeknight. Seats were decent and service was ok up till this point. We ordered based on previous experience and waiter recommendations. Our food came fairly quickly. The food quality and quantity was not really up to par with what you would expect from a Waikiki resteraunt. Also on the menu it said free refills on soft drinks. Yet when I asked for a refill the server told me he would have to charge me for it. Overall a bad experience. I would highly recommend you try one of the many other places around Waikiki or honolulu.

25160,1,"Very dissppointing experience. The cocktails tasted not good, but only like ice and alcohol. The decoration was poor. The worst cocktails for 16USD I ever had.

Besides this: The hotel claims to do something good for the environment by having abonded plastic straws BUT they use plastic onetime-use cups for all cocktails on the terrace. That makes no sense at all as the amount of waste is even bigger. A quailty restaurant or bar should always serve the food and drinks on and in quality cups and plates which is defintely not plastic for me.

We nabbed a great table right next to the beach, so the people watching, as well as staring at the beautiful ocean was great.  We ordered some chips and dips, along with the Cabana Limeade -- a drink for two.  Not impressed with either, particularly given their price.  The cocktail had little to no alcohol in it, which was a disappointment.

Service was solid initially, but waned and we literally had to go find the server to pay our bill.

This location doesn't use the tall cup to measure the frappaccino, they use the keiki cup to measure and what's worse when I called the barista on it she got an attitude and told me she was making my drink to ""code"" and that other locations don't make my drink to code.. excuse me?! I asked for a tall frappaccino with 3 extra shots of espresso.. if I wanted a keiki frappaccino with 3 extra shots I would have asked for that..

This is the real difference this is a total local restaurant that's been around from before I was born their concept everything they serve is from Hawaii Oahu it is fresh it is not Frozen it is the very best that anyone can offer in the way of authentic Hawaiian food.

The waitress that waited on me today as soon as I walked in notice that I hadn't been there for a while and that I was coming in at a later time that I normally do.

25458,1,"It's hard to imagine that a truly 'local' restaurant could be so blind to details that might make it stand out. Restaurants come and go and this one might just go. I was getting an oil change nearby today and I was hungry, so I saw Highway Inn and thought I would have a lau
lau.
When I arrived around 1 pm the place had a few tables- perhaps 6? I chose to sit at the bar. Wrong choice I guess. I sat there and watched everyone working, probably 4 people in total. I also could see the clearly open kitchen and thought it would be fun to see my food being prepared. So I waited, and I waited, and then, guess what? I waited. I finally asked the guest next to me if I had to order somewhere else or would someone serve me? He said that the service is always very slow and that eventually someone would greet me. He also showed me the menus stacked behind where I was sitting so I could at least decide what I wanted before the server arrived. So I again waited some more. Finally a young lady whom I believe was a kitchen worker came behind the bar to get some water. She saw me kind of looking around and asked me if I had been helped and if I needed a drink. I asked for a diet coke and thought she would take my order but told me such and such would be with me soon. So I once again patiently waited and about 6 minutes later someone asked me 'what do you want?' I said I would like a pork lau lau.
The food came out fairly quick considering how long it took to order. In the meantime I watched while 3 people tried to make a cocktail. Pretty humorous.
The laulau was just that, a lau lau plopped on a plate. I don't mind that but usually (Da Ono on Kapahulu) it is much larger and served with salt, onion, and chili pepper water. No big deal. So I asked the server, once I got her attention again if I could have a bit of onion. She asked me if I wanted it with spicy 'stuff' and I said yes. She returned quickly with a small dish of sliced onion and about a tablespoon of sea salt. I was on the phone so I couldn't say anything. I ended up using some Volcano hot sauce on the bar nearby.
The lau lau was ok- small for the price and bland, but I enjoyed it after adding the hot sauce, salt and onion. I asked for the check when I was done and then again waited for the check and waited for her to take the credit card. By now, you get the idea. Wait, wait, wait, and umm wait.
When I got the check it seemed to be a bit more than I thought but I was so ready to leave I just put down my card. She ran it, etc. etc.
After I left and was still waiting for my car-lol- I know- I waited all day for everything I did!!!
I then took a look at my receipt and saw that I was charged 0.55 cents for onion. OMG are you kidding me??? How the heck do you charge for something that automatically comes with lau lau at EVERY other place I have had it?? Even at Roy's they don't charge for a side of onion. Give. Me A. Break.
So if you have made it through this diatribe you realize that I will not return or recommend this restaurant to anyone. Don't go to places that nickle and dime you to death. Go to places that value the guest and make them feel welcome, and want them to return.

Food here is so amazing. I've eaten at many Hawaiian eateries and this one always takes first place.

Service: Super friendly

Location: Away from the Waikiki mayhem.

Parking: Limited

Wait: No long line ups

Food: Amazing! So are the portions.

Pork laulau is cooked with I think belly so there's so much flavor. My favorite dish.

Pipikaula is like korean short ribs, so good.

Kalua Pig good as always. Not salty like other places.

I got the smokin moco and it tasted fantastic. This place was on the road for 5 stars and then my friend eating across from me discovered hair in his food. And not just an eye lash that none of us would have cared about, but instead was a lock of hair that was tangled around his fork. Needless to say my appetite took a hit.

The food itself is still Hawaiian. ""Different,"" but in a good way. The poke was definitely different, but as if you chose a different flavor e.g. Shoyu vs spicy. I'll miss the old one, but the new one is just as good.

The lau lau is moist all the way through with just the perfect meat:fat ratio.

The kalua pig is about the same as you'd get from anywhere, but then so was the original.

The haupia is GOOD. I like the old one, but this one is slightly better in my opinion. Not watery.

Been coming for 23 years and tonight we were penalized for having happy hour... because we wanted happy hour, we could not sit outside... by the end of the night,  the majority of the tables outside were empty and we were jailed indoors...

Once it got dark, they said that we were next to go outside... but we spent 2 hours eating and drinking... makes no sense and is completely ridiculous!  Waste of a night. And hard earned money... you certainly know what hard
earned money is right?   What a slap in the face for me and my family.  Sorry bev the one star is there because that's the minimum it would allow me to rate my night at gannons.

The desserts we ordered were wonderful, too.  The cheesecake was not your ordinary slice. It was round, with a softened cheese center.  The final dessert was a surprise: flambe Strawberries!

26111,4,"Ruth's Chris Steak House is always a special time spent with good company and even better food! I was celebrating my birthday and my whole table was offered complimentary bubbly, always a nice touch. I had ordered the cowboy ribeye (with bone) instead of the usual ribeye because when will I ever be able to experience the best of the best again?  We ordered asparagus, brussels sprouts with bacon, mashed potatoes, ESCARGOT and lots of bread to go with it. All the sides were wonderfully delicious and flavorful in their own rights. The only bump in the night was when they had mistakenly prepared a ribeye, instead of the cowboy. They ended up sending the ribeye back and we had to wait for them to cook another steak. I had ordered a medium rare, but it was a little more undercooked than the usual, most likely trying to speed up the cooking slightly. I didn't mind it since their meat is such a high quality and aged steaks. It was a pleasurable change of my normal go to and wether things go according to plan or not, the staff are ALWAYS so very accommodating to providing the best dining experience for their customers!

26256,4,"First place I stopped to eat at after getting off the plane! The place was already packed around lunch time. There was a wait time of about 20 minutes or so. Worth it though.

There is very little parking here, and busy all around the block as well. Just keep circling until you find a spot.

The place is clean, simple, and cool. Yes they have air conditioning lol!

So the waitress was super nice and helpful. I decided to go with the ""Menu D"". It comes with a little bit of each of the following:

Kalua pig, lomi salmon, pipikaula short ribs, luau squid, poi, and haupia. Plus I ordered a small side of macaroni salad. The server that brought out the food was almost throwing the plates on the table, slamming them as of she hated being there, it was funny to me!

The servings were small, but this is the best because you get to ""try"" everything for taste purposes versus filling up on just one or two things. It's small but enough for 1 person. The kalua pig was my favorite, then the pipikaula short ribs, then the haupia. Everything was delicious, except the macaroni salad, it was okay. You can tell everything was fresh though.

Definitely a good stop here, I was happy I did. I will go back again. Thank you!",Helena's Hawaiian Food,"['Hawaiian restaurant', 'Restaurant']","Local draw known for homestyle Hawaiian cooking in a casual, no-frills space. Cash only.",1.071961524586178e+20_1557930470139

26258,1,"A big disappointment. Encouraged by the positive feedback, we decided to taste the traditional traditional Hawaiian style. The pork turned out to be nothing special. Mac and cheese spicy and tasteless. However, the ribs were the worst. Perfectly seasoned, but hard as a rock and TERRIBLY fat. They were literally dripping with grease. Using a few napkins to drain the fat helped. Shocker! I was disgusted. Chefs should see that the fat from the ribs is melting away, and they will get them for a long time to keep them soft. It wasn't cheap at all and the portions were very small.

This is cash only.
Parking is super limited - park in neighborhood and walk.

We got the kalua pork and pipikaula short ribs with a small poi. Also added a laulau.

Kalua pork - smoked pork, super tender.
Pipikaula short ribs - tastes like a thicker Korean galbi, just less sweet.
Laulau - pork wrapped in leaves. Super flavorful - my favorite item.
Poi - taro smash. Was nice to try but not our favorite. It was a slight bubbly feeling on your tongue from being fermented. Not a strong flavor but wasn't a fan of the texture.
Haupia - coconut milk dessert. Tastes like coconut jello. Perfect ending to the meal.

Poi - very Hawaiian, fermented taro. My parents and I did not enjoys but my fiance did. I think it is an acquired taste.

Kahlua pork - must get!!! Delicious.

Laulau - unique flavors, I enjoyed it, but also may be an acquired taste.

The salmon and tuna were okay, I would stick to Kahlua and laulau if I had to go back.

Shorts ribs were also average, nothing special about it.

They are located on King Street across from Kokua Market and next door to Pucks Alley.  There's street parking and a small parking lot that's shared with other restaurants.

Since my hubby turned vegetarian, we asked about vegetarian dishes and the waiter mentioned that all dishes can be vegetarian. By adding vegetables and tofu instead of meat or chicken.  He was the friendliest and most helpful waiter that I've ever encountered.

The Pad Thai was one of the best I've had. There noodles were cooked just right with the right amount of seasoning and it wasn't dry.  I'm not a fan of yellow curry but this was really tasty. The cook added eggplant and broccoli along with bamboo shoots and tofu.  We also had vegetarian summer rolls, though I wanted the regular shrimp summer roll.  It's thicker and longer than most summer rolls and a sweet peanut sauce.

I got the deep fried flounder, which was a complete meal, with miso soup, tsukemono,  rice and dipping sauce. The flounder bones were perfectly crispy. The fillets were ok by themselves, but delicious with the dipping sauce. Our waitress was a very hard worker and never stopped moving the entire time we were there.

There is a nice variety of dishes in the Honolulu shops, and our dishes were prepared promptly and well. My daughter got the fried gyoza curry rice, and the gyoza were quite tasty. So all that is great.
On the other hand, the fried shumai had a weird taste, almost as if there were minced onions in the breading.

Update: This place pre-covid was pretty good. The food was decent, but there were usually plenty of parking so I would come here when I didn't want to deal with the parking situation in Chinatown. After we got hit with covid, a quality of the food seems to have gone down. I don't know if it was because they had to freeze their food and that's why the quality of the dim sum was not as good as before. There were some dishes that it was pretty obvious that it was frozen because it didn't have that chewy texture that it normally does; it was very crumbly and has that old oil taste. I would not have minded as much except for the reaction that I got when I mentioned it to them. They had told me that I didn't know what I was talking about and that that is how it's supposed to taste. This made me a little upset because the pan fried turnip cake and the pan fried taro cake is one of my favorite dishes for dim sum. Being Chinese, I grew up eating dim sum almost every other week so I definitely do know what these things are supposed to taste like. Normally I would give places several chances before not coming back but I don't know if I would actually come back to this place since none of the things that I ordered was good. It was very subpar.

27023,4,"Went in happy, ate too much, and left feeling unhappy. No fault of Happy Days though - who knew a single egg tart could push me over the edge?

I love everything about Dim Sum, being able to eat right away, watching the carts go around, and having an endless supply of food at the end of my chopsticks. I've been on a mission lately to find a dim sum place, in or out of town, that could rival Happy Days and haven't found any yet - despite claims by others as ""The Best Dim Sum"", ""Good Dim Sum"", and a plethora of other ads that never quite lived up to bold statements.

I enjoy Happy Days because it's moderately priced, has an inexpensive lot in the back, and fast service. The staff are a little pushy, but nothing compared to some recent ventures.

The food is standard fare - from sticky sticky rice, stuffed eggplants, bean curd, egg tarts, to the not so (at least in my book) duck feet. Everything is quite tasty and some dishes cooked up in front of you. I haven't ordered any of their ""regular' dishes, and while I would have no qualms about it based on their dim sum dishes, just haven't made it.

Parking in the back, off 12th, is cheap and the only nearby municipal lot. The first 30 min is free and first hour is 75 cents. The best time to go seems to actually be lunch hour - they're at full staff and of the half dozen times I've been there, have never had to wait.

The staff is a little pushy, but usually stop before placing things on your table and telling you want it (something my last dim sum place would be good to take note of).

All in all a great place.

27123,4,"This place still reminds me of old school homey restaurant style everything. That's a good thing! Their saimin is my comfort food - with ""choke"" mustard, because I like it when you can actually taste it and it makes your nose run just enough! I don't stray from my usual saimin with side shrimp tempura, but my kids like the cheeseburger and fries, and my man likes their combo plates (and green river!). The last time we were there, they didn't have their yummy cone sushi, and I don't know if they still offer it, but that was always my mom's favorite. The older aunties are just friendly enough to not make you feel uncomfortable and they're pretty efficient too.

We hopped in the water, realized the waves are ridiculously powerful and pulled you back in for wave after wave of CIA water boarding.

Good for surfing, and if you can swim well, you should be okay. If you can't swim or barely can swim I can't recommend this beach is right for you.

27678,5,"Writing this review is brings back such fond memories of my trip to Hawaii, especially this place since I was so close. This was one of the first places I went to and was actually the last place I came to for a final taste of Hawaii to end my trip. It was everything I could have ever hoped for and more. The first time I walked in, I was greeted so kindly and they were not hesitant to have us try some samples. In my opinion, the way to go is the guava chicken and kalbi mixed plate. It was outstanding and I really wish I had more of it. Luckily, they are very generous with the portion so you will be full. Also a good thing to note is to grab a bunch of the guava sauce! Absolutely delicious. It can get very busy because of the lunch rush from the nearby army base so be sure to plan out a good time to come.

27812,3,"It's located in an odd place. It's like in a mini  shopping center at the back. It's somewhat nice though. It wants to be high class and does it kind of middle road.  The service was top notch and the menu seems ok as well. I ended up getting a couple of drinks and the prime rib. I did have a local rum on the menu, something called Kea. I'll be honest, it almost ruined my night. I will typically stick with Captain Morgan, but I figure, when in Rome... So, as for the steak, it was very good at the beginning, but the more and more I ate, the less I wanted to finish it. It was way too salty for my taste. I would have preferred unseasoned and my own salt and pepper with some au jus.  Would I go again, possibly. Since the service stood out and it was relatively quiet (I like quiet restaurants).

One thing to say right off the back is that they are a cash only place. One of the reasons why they only got 4 stars instead of 5 is that they accept only cash but they have no signs anywhere that states that. I didn't find out till I tried to pay, but luckily they let me run to an ATM really quick.

The other reason why this place got only 4 stars was that the service was a little lacking. Our waitress seemed like she was counting the minutes until her shift ended and it took work to flag her down.

28175,4,"This theater is significantly more enjoyable since they've gone through renovations. The seats are now big cushy red recliners that allow you to lean back and put your feet up while you watch the movie, very comfortable. You can also book your tickets and seats online with an additional ""convenience"" fee which is cool. Try to avoid the first two rows closest to the screen: the viewing angles are worse the closer you get. I was seated in the second row and I had to keep turning my head to the left and right depending where the action was going on, made me a bit dizzy after awhile. Also, sound quality is pretty bad. My TV at home with a mid-range sound system sounds significantly better.

The workers are pleasant, and the concession stand has all the mandatory theater food fair. They're generous with the popcorn which is always appreciated!

28376,5,"You must come and explore these caves. Be sure to get there early in the morning if you want to avoid the crowds. These are popular with mostly one way in and out. BUT if you rather enter the cave on the left at the base of the stairs at the beginning, you can get out to the other end of it. Easy to walk through it with a couple spots where you need to go over some big rocks and boulders. You can tell that there is another exit at the other end by feeling the breeze hitting your face once you get inside. There are two ways at the end of the cave to make it back to the parking lot. Make sure that you follow the trail to the right. That will take you straight to the starting point. If you follow the trail towards the left, you'll basically go around and enter a neighborhood near the Kaumana Elementary School. Be aware that the trails are overgrown since it is not permitted to exit the cave to the back side. This a small adventure in the dark. Bring a good flash light and mosquito repellent.

After going down the stairs, the cave on the right is pretty short and would be great if you're nervous about going too deep underground. On the left, that cave has a smaller place you can ""squeeze"" into (just bend over to walk in), which opens into a very tall and wide tunnel that you can walk through. I'm not sure exactly how long it took to get to the other end, but I'd say maybe 15 to 20 minutes?

We only went about 40 yards or so in - as it's very dark and very slippery, but it was well worth it nonetheless. Bring good shoes and a flashlight, even if you only plan to go a little ways - and no a cell phone flash will not suffice.

The caves do get damp so don't jump when you get some rain drops hitting you, also watch your step as the rocks can get slick and jagged so tripping can occure. But definitely recommend it if your into adventure stuff. The actual ""hike"" into the caves is just down a steep flight of stairs and one cave to the right and the other to the left.

There are two caves here. One has a smaller entrance and goes under the road. The other one which is larger and gets more attention goes the opposite way.

Here was our big surprise: In 1999, we came to a point where we could not progress without sliding through water on our backs or stomachs; that's where we turned around. In 2017, we encountered no such barrier, and made it all the way to an exit of sorts, which had been blocked with bars, but someone had cut one out.

Some stop when it narrows and bending over is necessary to continue further into the cave. It's a really amazing experience for anyone. Kids and adults alike.

I'm in their standing alone in the store still empty handed. There was about 4-5 employees. Non attentive. Finally I had to go and ask why was two simple cups of coffee taking long, are they brewing a barrell or something? Finally they all jump. I just wanted my money back and preferred to go across the street to 7-11 at that point. Didnt want to give me my refund. Gave me my two cups of coffee which I didn't even want anymore at that point, and gave me a gift card that I couldn't even use on my app or in another store that I went to. So all the way around, this location is a bust. So disappointed. Wasn't a drink they had to mix and steam or whatever. It was simple coffee. Come on, Starbucks, everywhere else is always on point, what's up with this location? I've been to other locations where the employees notice if a customer is waiting for a little bit than probably should and those stores are busy! But the employees are attentive, the Alakea St. location!

One can see Diamond Head and Waikiki; downtown and mauka; the harbor and mountains; and nicest of all, out to the ocean.

29004,1,"They didn't want to do takeout orders on the particular morning I went in to order for my family at home. The waitresses were about to help with the order, but the owner said no. Inflexible and bad service.

Update in response to owner: You would think that in times of inclement weather, you'd want to extend your hand to customers who can't physically make it out to the restaurant as easily (e.g. senior family members), which is why I went out by myself to bring food back to my family at home. Anyway, it doesn't really matter, I left right away without making any fuss, and went to another place nearby that gladly helped with a simple takeout order without a second thought. There are several delicious and friendly options nearby, and I would suggest anyone reading this to give the other places a shot before considering this cafe.

29120,4,"Unfortunately, I had a bad trip here the other day. From start to finish I waited 26 minutes. They were having a usual morning rush, so I didn't take it too personal. Normally it's a very quick and friendly experience here.

The parking is quite annoying because of the area that it is in, though. So if you're already in the area it's nice to stop by, but having to drive in, park, and get out, by Hilo standards, it's not in the easiest of lots. I don't fault the store or the workers for that, it just is what it is, especially with not having a drive thru.

Overall I prefer the Starbucks on Kilauea, not to mention it is the only one with a drive thru. I'll probably stick to going to that one over this one, unless I'm already at the mall or something.

An added tip, their iced coffee is very watered down tasting lately. Taste your drink before you leave and be sure to let them know if you need a little added coffee.

And they have great tacos, nachos, and others on their menu. It's like a subway set up; you choose your ""base"" (taco? burrito?) and then your meat. Then they ask you what you want in it. Some of the choices I remember are: Tomatoes, Avocado, beans, fried beans, Spanish or white rice, lettuce, cheese, etc. Then they ask you what kind of sauce. I chose the spicy one (Baha) but they had 3 other choices if spice isn't your thing. But if spice IS your thing, they have super spicy condiments next to the soft drink dispenser. I think I met the owner of the establishment while I was there. We told him how this was the first time we'd been there and he gave us a promotion card, buy one taco get one free!

29390,3,I've only recently started buying pizzas again and will not buy from Sam's club or Costco for clearly obvious reasons. The problem with this particular Pizza Hut is they either cooked it way too early or gave me someone else's cold pizza because it was not even room temperature when I brought it home. I use a special bag to keep it warm during the travel time of 12 minutes home and was not only shocked but extremely disappointed. I had driven over the Kamehameha shopping center much further and it was still above warm not hot but between warm and hot when I arrived home and I just had it in the box nothing else. There is one closer on  keeamouku. I'm going to go there and try it out. oh and not to mention the label that seals the box was broken open so they either sat there too long they didn't even know what it was but it wasn't kept under a warmer.... it wasn't even warm I'm very disappointed I don't recommend this store!!! only went there because someone told me it was much much better I disagree.,Pizza Hut,"['Pizza delivery', 'Chicken wings restaurant', 'Takeout Restaurant', 'Pizza restaurant']",Family-friendly chain known for its made-to-order pizzas.,1.1603362738670589e+20_1616535442404

29604,5,"Update Aug 2012: Landed, picked up the car, then headed straight over to Shimazu's. Today, I tried the creme brulee and red velvet creme combo, with condensed milk on top. Sooo good. There'll probably be a line, plus parking may be hard to find, but it's worth it, IMHO. Tomorrow we're hitting a couple others, including Matsumoto's, but I still think this is the best on Oahu. The ice is sooo smooth, that's it's almost like you're eating ice cream instead of shaved ice (maybe it's the syrup they use?).

Aug 2011:
Having just flied over from Kauai (where our family consensus picked Shave Ice Paradise as the best) - we now can have some REAL shave ice. In the past we've tried Matsumoto's and Wailoa's, but Shimazu's is REALLY good - making those overpriced Kauai shops look like they don't know what they're doing. This guy is really friendly and his staff (family?) are really nice. Their small size looks like those other guys' ex-large and it's really cheap. Flavors are top-notch and the ice is soooo smooth. I hate it when your spoon has to chip away at the cone and then the piece falls to the ground quickly melting in the Hawaiian-sun-baked-sidewalks. This shop's cones are just perfect. he also creates his own mochi so feel free to add that in as well (it kinda reminds me of those Boton rice candy treats). Anyway, if you're seeking great shave ice, don't leave out Shimazu!

There's also a bagpiper on certain nights as well as a Hawaiian traditional singer who will teach the audience about Hawaiian language and songs. But that's only available on the roof deck (call the lanai) during sunset on certain days so call ahead to find out if you can sit there and if they're doing it that night.

The prices are somewhat high but the food is really good and the portions are large. If you have to choose between Fleetwood's and Mama's Fish House, for a two-person dinner date you'll probably get tastier food, larger portions, and save about a hundred bucks. It doesn't have the same ocean view that Mama's has but the sunset view is incredible especially if you're up on the deck (lanai). Both are great options I just think that there's more value at Fleetwood's.

They have interesting menu items like lobster tacos and extensive beers and cocktails. There's also live music every night on the main floor and everyone has a good seat.

29857,5,"I love Fleetwoods. First of all I never know when I'll  run into Mick Fleetwood or Jolly Ol St Mick as I like to call him. Whatta sweet guy! I enjoy sparing with him. He is so playful.
Then there is this ambience that feels like a nostalgic rockstar English pub and that cant be beat. But what tops the cale is that its multi-storied and each floor has it's own special qualities and music and menus and attracts a diverse mostly interesting crowd, typically of tourists but ya never know....
My favorite parts of the establishment are seats by the 2nd story windows th at overlook Front Street. (And on Halloweeen they are especially coveted to oversee the parade of costumes down below.
Then there is the icing on top of it- the rooftop bar. Open aired and pretty intimate sensual in atmosphere.
