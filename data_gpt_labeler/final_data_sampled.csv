Incredible food, amazing staff, and an overall wonderful experience had by all. I have been a few times and love it more and more each time I go.

Most important thing i will say in this whole review- get the short rib for your main course and the ice cream ""coconut"" for dessert. The short rib is tender and flavorful and melts in your mouth. Also a big enough portion to take a piece home and enjoy it again for a late night snack. wow. just thinking of it makes me want to look up flights to hawaii. the ice cream coconut is so festive and yummy.

My vegetarian friends were visiting from the mainland and we decided Arancino would be the right place for us. I like this area of Waikiki because the restaurant is on a short side street and you don't have to drive deep in the mix. The restaurant offers validated parking in the Bank of Hawaii lot which is perfect since i drive a tank and the lot has wide-enough stalls.

The restaurant doesn't take reservations and I knew there would be a wait so our party agreed on meeting early - we got there at about 5:45 and were seated by 6:30. We could've maybe grabbed a quick drink at Yardhouse but instead, we decided to kill time with a leisurely walk around the block and popped into a couple stores on Lewers St. When we made it back, we waited only about 10 minutes and our party was ready to be seated.
My BF and I split the spaghetti con tobiko e calamari and pizza peperoni e salsiccia.Both were fantastic! I loved the crunch the tobiko added to the dish, and the pizza crust was beautifully crispy.

Enjoyed the chili sprinkles on the toast and dipped the toast into the meatball sauce.  Oh soo good.  Always game for a good meatball and these were good.  You get 3 meatballs.

I'm not a fan of the Lavender latte (it's VERY lavender, like you're drinking essential oils but hey, what did I expect haha).

Also, there's very very very little seating so if you come at a breakfast or lunch hour, or you come on a weekend, expect to wait a very long time for a seat or have to take your meal to-go.

407529,5,"One of the best small coffee shops in Honolulu. Aussie-owned (""arvo"", get it? Except they are open in the mornings), so yes, you CAN get vegemite toast here.

Accept credit cards using Foursquare.

Fresh ingredients, as locally sourced as possible.

Lovely outdoor seating. Very limited indoor seating. Shares a space with the Paiko flower shop. Often a line starting around 10 o'clock, so get there early if you can.

Definitely spring for the loaded avocado toast, the smoked salmon toast, the lavender latte. It might seem pricey for toast, but no, it's not just toast. Food quality is good, shop is clean, and portions of higher-priced items are generous. Expect the full quarter pound or so of very decent quality smoked salmon on your salmon toast. Food is served on wooden planks, so um, those capers? Yeah, they'll roll, so be prepared to lose a few or grab a fork and knife at the front. Edible flowers garnish most dishes. Beautiful presentation, though often very messy. Order inside, get your table marker, grab an outdoor table, and they will bring the food out to you. Grab extra napkins at the front or bring your own small bag of hand wipes. You'll need them.

Cuppa comes with coffee art, but not obnoxious or interferes with the flavor. Matcha latte is very strong here. If you're looking for a watered-down Starbucks version, go there.

183104,3,"For the beginner: The room themes were clever. I'd recommend the Y2K style room. Bring a group and have fun. Not a bad place to start to get into escape rooms if you're just looking to have a little fun.

The for experienced: I've done all of their rooms now and would only recommend one of them to a friend (Y2K). The other rooms had broken or missing clues. We tried to challenge a couple we know but when we did the same room an entire set of clues was left out. If you're bored and really need a scratch your escape room itch give it a go. If you can wait, if definitely wait.

Plus side: they let you book private rooms for a small fee for each person. Not bad when you want to do it with only two people for the challenge.

My wife ended up Scampi with Rigatoni, her least favorite pasta, without any warning from the waitress.  We sent that back to the kitchen to substitute Garlic Mash Potatoes.

From the moment that I entered the store until a transaction took the service was excellent. They listened to what I had to say and provided me options for exactly what I asked for. They are perfect examples of social distancing and availability of hand sanitizer. It is perhaps unfair to mention names because EVERY person in the boutique must and should be recognized for excellent service. Even after the transaction was complete they took an equal amount of time to make sure the purchase was beautifully wrapped fit for presentation to royalty. Even as I was about to depart they wisely  shared with me new fragrances released on Saturday August 15th. I highly recommend you take time for indulgence in yourself. Take time to treat someone regardless if it's you or a loved one something wonderful from this boutique. Go there and indulge yourself. You deserve that. Stay safe. Aloha. Douglas

Let me tell you, I literally looked like a homeless person, just got off a plane rolled into here after trekking all over the beach, had a hole in my shirt and dirt on my jean shorts and she greeted me like I was the queen on England with a friendly smile and no uppity attitude like most other sales people at Chanel. Usually when I walk into Chanel looking like I did, no one offers to help me unless I ask and even then they usually reluctantly help me or not so nicely tell me I probably can't afford it.

She not only made me feel comfortable but also went out of her way to look for a limited run bag I've been looking for everywhere in NYC.

They look like they don't wanna work and very intimidating, uncomfortable vibe. Many times asked manager for someone else. Most recently, I felt so insulted I abruptly left the saleswoman, went to Chanel Waikiki and spent almost 10K. Since then managers are greeting me at AlaMoana.

---------------------------------

2 stars.  Food here is yucky to the point of inedible. Pastry is okay and drinks are good here.

Ordered a plate lunch with mushroom and chicken.  The chicken was meh and I really liked the mushrooms but the rice had hard bits mixed in like left over from the night before.  Shame on them, can't get decent rice here. In the trash it goes.

Ordered pizza with a custard drink.  I loved the drink but the pizza was the saltiest thing ever.  I thought cook was having an off day so I gave it another chance.  I  ordered pizza again for lunch  but requested ""no salt"".  The second time was even saltier. Yuck!  Zero stars , trash can buddy.

I think getting sugary donuts are okay but stay away from the other foods they offer.  I would strongly recommend you eat dinner and lunch elseware.

Friendly staff and peaceful ambiance.

The waters were blue and beautiful and very calm to snorkel in. We were told that if you go on an overcast day (like we did) you will see more fish.

As soon as you walk in you are welcomed warmly and when they walk you to your table they hold back the tablecloth for you to slide into your seat. This was such a nice touch!

The entire staff is warm and friendly.  You can tell that they all pride themselves on customer service!

We were lucky enough to meet the chef who is nothing short of amazing!

The prices are higher here than most places but you are paying for an experience.  I can tell you it is well worth every penny you spend as the food is so fantastic that I find it hard to provide words to explain it.

We began with glasses of Champagne and the Wagyu tartare and charcuterie for 2. The charcuterie was a visual and taste delight; a meal in itself. The tartare was served with delicate chips to use as serving vessels. We would have preferred a raw quail egg as the tartare needed a touch more moisture.  We ordered the American Wagyu and the catch of the day (Ono) for our entrees, accompanied by a glass of pinot noir for the steak and a white with the Ono. Both entrees were visual and taste delights.

Easy access right off king st is the awe inspiring Chef Mavro. Fresh top notch ingredients combined with true mastery and thoughtful execution. Simple and beautiful decor. It is expensive, but so is a Lamborghini and IT IS WORTH IT.
We had 9 courses and this was the food that must only had originally been served in heaven and like other mythic wonders, man stole them from the gods and brought them to share with mortal kind.

The elysian lamb is worth waging wars over. Hand raised lamb like wagyu are, the meticulous process yields only the finest result. With coconut and date chutneys, the sweet notes sing clearly while the parsnips vadouvan curry and essence of cilantro bring balance and poise to prevent oversweetness.

An epic ballad could be written for each course, from diver scallops to honeydew in champagne gelee.

545803,5,"When it comes to finding a spectacular place to dine in Hawaii, you have no shortage of local restaurants willing to cater to your needs.  If you are anything like me you are willing to search for that special place to convey the emotion you feel for the person or people you choose to dine with.

My sisters birthday is a special moment for me and my family so I wanted to ensure she felt like a queen.  I used opentable to reserve that special table, but due to a scheduling conflict I was unable to dine on her birthday.  I placed a call to Chef Mavro  within 24 hours of my reservations and they were happy to reschedule me(FREE OF CHARGE).

My first time dining with Chef Mavro was a experience I can never forget.  On the menu for desert were small carmel candies that left an impression of perfection.  I placed a call to the restaurant to confirm if the candies could be remade.  I was placed on hold and spoke directly to Chef Mavro.  We discussed in detail the menu for the night and he suggested I stick with the assigned menu desserts.

I realized the night of the dinner I would be running late, and placed a call to the front desk to confirm they would inform my party of my tardiness.  ""Sure Giovanni we will be happy to entertain your guest, until you arrive.""  I was relieved to arrive before my guest and ensure my sister table looked ""perfect""

I chose the 6 course meal for us with the wine pairings and could not be happier with presentation.  The highlight of the night was the hand made birthday cake with a single candle.  She smiled in embarrassment but noticed the look on my face as tears  began to stream as the waiter placed a additional plate with 5 small hand made caramels with a simple note...""just for you Giovanni, thanks for coming back""

I highly recommend Chef Mavro for a unique dining experience second to none.

We were thinking that with the price in the menu, we would be eating something special. Instead the crabs we ate are thin and without any meat.

We were so disappointed. We could barely hear the cracking fresh sound crab shells usually emits when you crack open it.

It is not worth the money we paid for the meal. With that in mind, it is as if we were paying for an expensive crab cracker we got as souvenir instead of enjoying a delicious crab meal.

You can't go wrong with anything involving the tuna or salmon, and the local maguro nigiri is a must.

1350722,3,"Giving a 3 for quality based on price.

For the location, this place definitely fits the price point, but absolutely not the quality or freshness of sushi. We ordered a bunch of nigiri, and two basic rolls, I could honestly compare the quality of the fish to high end buffet fish. Nothing out of the ordinary. We have been to plenty of sushi joints on the mainland, and I believe the sushi here would rate as a 2 in quality back home

The other disappointing thing was the smell, at first we thought it was ammonium but later figure out it smelled like dirty wet cleaning rags in the whole place.

I will say that the service was good, waiter was very prompt, quick and VERY attentive.

I hiked half of this with a baby on my back before giving in and allowing a friend to carry him the rest of the way. I was out of breath and light headed.  I often leaned against trees to catch my breath and layed down for 20 minutes to let the light headedness pass... but important to note, while it might be slippery at times, there are many exposed tree roots and rocks to get your footing and almost the entire hike is shaded by trees. I agree, this hike would be absolutely ridiculous in the mud or rain. My kids 4, 5 and 8 did great... they loved it!

The food was fantastic, generous portions prepared as ordered (medium rare) along with fresh salsa, pico di gallo, beans and rice.

1055321,5,"Great restaurant with live music every night! Better food and better prices than Mama's Fish House!

There's also a bagpiper on certain nights as well as a Hawaiian traditional singer who will teach the audience about Hawaiian language and songs. But that's only available on the roof deck (call the lanai) during sunset on certain days so call ahead to find out if you can sit there and if they're doing it that night.

The prices are somewhat high but the food is really good and the portions are large. If you have to choose between Fleetwood's and Mama's Fish House, for a two-person dinner date you'll probably get tastier food, larger portions, and save about a hundred bucks. It doesn't have the same ocean view that Mama's has but the sunset view is incredible especially if you're up on the deck (lanai). Both are great options I just think that there's more value at Fleetwood's.

They have interesting menu items like lobster tacos and extensive beers and cocktails. There's also live music every night on the main floor and everyone has a good seat.

E got the duck with cannellini beans with ham which she ate to the bone, grandpa had the pink snapper, which he said was a bland fish, however he liked how the capers added such beautiful flavor with the spinach and the rest of his dish, and I had the beef filet which was more medium then medium rare, but was good because of how it was sauced and the sweet potato mash was a winner, so much so that E ate half of it and then asked is this sweet potato? Normally she avoids sweet potatoes at home. And dessert... Creme Caramel and Gateau Chocolate (sp?) were perfect.

899303,4,"Went in happy, ate too much, and left feeling unhappy. No fault of Happy Days though - who knew a single egg tart could push me over the edge?

I love everything about Dim Sum, being able to eat right away, watching the carts go around, and having an endless supply of food at the end of my chopsticks. I've been on a mission lately to find a dim sum place, in or out of town, that could rival Happy Days and haven't found any yet - despite claims by others as ""The Best Dim Sum"", ""Good Dim Sum"", and a plethora of other ads that never quite lived up to bold statements.

I enjoy Happy Days because it's moderately priced, has an inexpensive lot in the back, and fast service. The staff are a little pushy, but nothing compared to some recent ventures.

The food is standard fare - from sticky sticky rice, stuffed eggplants, bean curd, egg tarts, to the not so (at least in my book) duck feet. Everything is quite tasty and some dishes cooked up in front of you. I haven't ordered any of their ""regular' dishes, and while I would have no qualms about it based on their dim sum dishes, just haven't made it.

Parking in the back, off 12th, is cheap and the only nearby municipal lot. The first 30 min is free and first hour is 75 cents. The best time to go seems to actually be lunch hour - they're at full staff and of the half dozen times I've been there, have never had to wait.

The staff is a little pushy, but usually stop before placing things on your table and telling you want it (something my last dim sum place would be good to take note of).

All in all a great place.

This is cash only.
Parking is super limited - park in neighborhood and walk.

We got the kalua pork and pipikaula short ribs with a small poi. Also added a laulau.

Kalua pork - smoked pork, super tender.
Pipikaula short ribs - tastes like a thicker Korean galbi, just less sweet.
Laulau - pork wrapped in leaves. Super flavorful - my favorite item.
Poi - taro smash. Was nice to try but not our favorite. It was a slight bubbly feeling on your tongue from being fermented. Not a strong flavor but wasn't a fan of the texture.
Haupia - coconut milk dessert. Tastes like coconut jello. Perfect ending to the meal.

219982,5,"What an amazing place! My wife, Dad and I hiked here on July 5th-without searching online for directions you pretty much won't be able to find it. A shorter jungle hike(1 mile each way) with only a couple of steep climbs to access both waterfalls. Water shoes work best. At places the trail is muddy but not horrible. We got there at 715 and there was only one other person. We had both sets of falls to ourselves. The first set of falls was HORRENDOUS for mosquitoes, and at the second set there were none. Supposedly you can cliff jump into the first set but it looked pretty risky. The second set we swam in and there is a rope swing.(there is one dangerous boulder in the water so have someone stand by it while the other person swings in so they dont hit it) When we got back to the car at 945 the parking area was full and there were many people on the trail as we hiked out.

The trail before the descent is pretty easy except for a few downed trees in your way. And some rocks and tree roots. The Hopi'i Falls is closed. This is the first falls, which we loved jumping and swimming in. It is freshwater. The trail is challenging to find, as it starts off the side of a residential road.

When I was there on April 22nd I had 4. Some things are not on the buffet line and must be ordered through your server. Two examples of this are true Mainstays of Hoku's; the fried ahi poke musubi (the best musubi I have ever had) and work fried soft shell crab.
The prime rib and rack of lamb we're a perfect medium rare, juicy and tender. The king crab legs were succulent. I loved the shrimp and asparagus tempura as well as the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. They have pokes, shrimp cocktail, sushi, ahi sashimi, salads and much more. All is of exceptional quality.
For dessert I had the best bread pudding and coconut cake I have ever had!
Along with this is extraordinary service, from the lovely, professional and efficient host people, the extraordinary servers, Lisa and Georgia and all other employees that I encountered.

There are many beautiful glass pieces in here for decor and also some functional ones light sconces and bar lighting.

I like that the workshop is active and you can see live demonstrations of how they make the glass.

It's very beautiful and some of the best craftsmanship I saw.  I also so their items at the Four Seasons hotel at Wailea where I stayed where they were featured one day in the open air space and at the ferry landing the day I arrived in a few of the art galleries.

The hotel staff were very friendly as was every person we encountered on the island. Having the restaurant within the complex made going to dinner easy with our 10 week old grandson.

The hotel is perfect for those that want to get away, do nothing but relax.  Read a book by the pool or while take an afternoon nap in a hammock are about the most lively things going on there except for the chickens on the property.  The rooms are clean and have just the right immensities to make for a comfortable stay.

There is a restaurant on the property that serves lunch and dinner, but only does breakfast on the weekends.  There is also a bar attached to the restaurant if you want to sit and relax before dinner.  I highly recommend making reservations for dinner as it does get busy and seating is limited.

The parking isn't great and the bathrooms are single stall bathrooms. The inside is a bit cramped but they use the lanai in the front of the building and the hallway next to it for overflow. We sat inside and I'm grateful for that the hallway seemed stuffy and the outside lanai lacked lighting.

I'm glad I had an opportunity to go back there! For the quality of fish...now this place is the best Sushi deal in town! (I mean...There's more pricey Sushi places with the equally or better  quality of fish out there but this is the best price!)
Because of that it's now even more hard to make a reservation nor walk in so I def recommend to book way ahead of time.
Here's why I only give them one more star than 3 more...I understand they get busy, overwhelming n all however whenever you bother the customers you MUST always check what's going on the table first!!!
While we are waiting on our check this manager lady rudely came up to our table by saying there's another customers are waiting for your table next so to hurry and leave already!  Wow! Ofcourse we snapped back at her by telling her that we are not the one dragging our time longer, hugging the table YOU are!  We told her how rude she inturrupting us in this way but she just said yea yea n left.
I was really excited to bring my friends over here n we really had a great time but this lady totally ruined our experience at the end. Btw her name is Kayo. She should learn what a customer service is again for real.

it's okay. I was very excited about this place and not so much satisfaction after wards... yea, they're clean and nice because it's a brand new sushi place but for that prices I expected to be better quality of fish, sushi. out of my orders Uni(which is my favorite) and Scallop were too fishy to eat.

The atmosphere is great, it's fun meeting new people, but it is very close to the highway and its associate noise. The initial plates were great, full of flavours and beautifully presented. But then came the salad which I think needed something other than just lettuce.. for the main, the meatball lacked seasoning and was bland. As for the dessert, the chocolate was gritty, which means powdered chocolate was used unfortunately.

This was one of the first places I went to and was actually the last place I came to for a final taste of Hawaii to end my trip. It was everything I could have ever hoped for and more. The first time I walked in, I was greeted so kindly and they were not hesitant to have us try some samples. In my opinion, the way to go is the guava chicken and kalbi mixed plate. It was outstanding and I really wish I had more of it. Luckily, they are very generous with the portion so you will be full. Also a good thing to note is to grab a bunch of the guava sauce! Absolutely delicious. It can get very busy because of the lunch rush from the nearby army base so be sure to plan out a good time to come.

181529,5,"If you are tired of Pho, you have to try King of Thai Boat Noodles for that noodle soup experience at a whole different level.

Don't get me wrong, I still love pho noodles, but it is kind of the same after a while. Thai boat noodles offer richer soup bases and more varieties of noodle choices to change it up from the simplicity of pho noodle soups.

The Combination Beef Noodle Soup offers a rich and spicy dark broth loaded with hearty chunks of different beef. It is truly filling and satisfying, so you won't be hungry for a while.

For something way different, there is the Yen Ta Fo Noodle Soup. It offers lots of seafood in a red bean based broth that is impossible to describe, but something you must try. I am not sure if it is for everyone and probably need to be in the mood for it, but very good all the same.

The Crab Meat Fried Rice is a great dish to share. It has lots of crab meat that has been perfectly fried with onions in the rice. Simple on the ingredients, which is perfect for highlighting the crab meat flavor that comes out.

Of course they make classic Thai Green Papaya Salad, which is made fresh to order. The balance of ingredients really makes this dish a perfect starter or side with you order.

The place is very clean and well lighted. Service was friendly and fast. Over all value of their dish prices was very good and well worth it.

Also, make sure to dress light, have some dependable shoes and wear a hat. Walking up this trail, the sun is literally beating down on you. The weather that day was like 87 but felt like 97 on that climb. Needless to say our bottle of water was gone by the time we got to the top.

Don't worry if you are not a fan of hot food, they do have mild curries to choose from.  Also, being Indian food, there are lots of vegetarian options for those living on a plant based diet.

For me, it has got to have meat and be spicy.  I zeroed in on the Pepper Chicken and Lamb Tikka Masala. Wow, both were over the top with great spices and preparation.  The yellow rice was a nice compliment for the curries, but if you want brown rice, they got that as well.

They have a few other items other then curry to complete or make your meal and I really enjoyed my homemade Ginger Lemonade that I got to wash down the spice with. Really was perfect to cleanse the palate after such a flavor extravaganza.

404509,4,"After reading a few less than flattering reviews, I have to say I was a bit nervous about my stay at the Kuhio Banyan Club. However,  my concerns were for naught, I had a great time! Upon initial entry to the room, it was fairly clean and well presented. The full kitchenette was a big plus, even if it was just utilised for preparing basic meals and snacks. While the building itself was a bit dated, it certainly didn't bother me. Especially for the cheap price. We were also in need of early checkout due to our flight, and this was accommodated easily.

In short, the location is fantastic, the service good, and the price wonderful. If you can handle not being in a 5-star resort, then the Kuhio Banyan Club is definitely a worthy place to consider, particularly if you're trying to holiday on the cheap.",Kuhio Banyan Club,['Hotel'],Straightforward rooms with kitchenettes in an no-nonsense hotel offering beach gear.,1.1327770527477654e+20_1475454359020

Went just before sunset when there were only a few other people here.

700880,1,"I first went to La Spezia last July.  I really enjoyed the food, service and ambiance.   I've since recommended it to several people.  In my job, I find myself frequently in a position to make such recommendations.   Tonight I suggested my daughter and her boyfriend go there for a romantic dinner on their last night in Kauai.  Huge mistake on my part. They checked in with the host by 6.30, and were told to expect a 15 minute wait.  After watching multiple groups who arrived after them get seated, they were seated around 7.15.  When they inquired two different times about the wait, the host was cut and dismissive.  Waitress was minimally attentive,  and when finally served, ravioli was cold and veal was marginal.  My daughter and her boyfriend have both worked as wait staff, and are very sympathetic about busy nights in restaurants.   However, they feel they were treated indifferently, perhaps due to their age  (early 20s), and a mistaken impression that they would not tip well.  I was disappointed in their evening, and embarrassed by my recommendation.  Sadly, I can no longer suggest patronizing this establishment.",La Spezia,"['Italian restaurant', 'Bar', 'Restaurant']",Cozy atmosphere for homestyle Italian dishes paired with selections from the wine bar.,1.0921132159447161e+20_1549869537609

636013,3,"Bottom Line: Good Drink, 1 for 2 on the food, inconsistent service, hesitant to recommend.

We started with the Hen of the Wood Mushroom, which was fantastic. The fried pork belly and asparagus were great accents.

The old fashion was recommended by the waitresss an didn't disappoint. The bitters were the perfect accompaniment to the bourbon. Although the menu stated that the bourbon was Livestock selected Maker's Mark...it was actually Elijah Craig? It was even printed as Makers on my receipt...Either way, well executed besides the confusion on what's inside.

We selected the leg of lamb as our main. The lamb was sliced thin and seared. This led to the meat being overdone and jerky like. I think it would been executed better as a roast ad cut to order. Some of the vegetables were underdone. Overall a promising dish that underwhelmed.

One strang side note, the bathroom soap was way overpowering, interfering with the taste of my drink and meal.

I would've liked to share these issues with the staff, but I wasn't asked how my meal went.

Overall, I would be hesitant to recommend this restaurant...as the issues I experienced seem to be apart of the normal operation.

The service was good. I liked the people there.

The acoustics of the place are poor. Everything is loud and chaotic sounding.

I like the high ceilings and the retro (or perhaps low budget) feel of the historic chinatown building it is located inside of.

The problem with this place is the food. It is nothing special at all. I would describe it as very salty, rich, and cooked. I prefer fresh, mildly flavored, light.

Forgot the Chile sauce again.
I always ask for it up when ordering.
It's so unfortunate to see our favorite local restaurant in our area, go down the tubes like this.
Last time they blamed It on the chef being out of town.

We had the washing machine break in the condo we rented through VRBO while we were staying there, and when we went to the management company, they wouldn't help at all. Makes sense since the owners of the condo are taking business away from the company. We had to deal with the owners on the mainland while we were stuck with a mess. They accused us of having broke their washer and dryer since it had worked for them for the five months they wee staying there.  When we finally convinced the owners that we are not idiots and their washer just broke, they finally started to work to get a repairman out.

Overall the food is fantastic. I give the food 5 stars. Portions are great and everything is well prepared. The price though seems rather steep. I guess I got spoiled because I used to be able to bring my family here for a meal.  That's no longer the case as a local family this is an expensive treat.

If you're here on vacation though I recommend you have a meal here. This is not authentic Mexican food by any means and it's not completely infused with Island flair.

I haven't had any good Italian food on the island untill I ate here!

They serve complimentary fresh baked bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar

I'm not a big tomato fan, but the Bruschetta was a delicious and refreshing appetizer.

The Lobster Ravioli is a must try. It's perfectly balanced with fresh lobster and creamy white sauce.

I had the Hazelnut Ice cream for dessert and it's basically the best gelato I've ever had. Think about Nutella Icecream!

The owner Fabrizio, originally from Roma, and is one of the nicest people I've met on the island, very personable. He even escorted us out!

I highly recommend this place, and will definitely be back!

Mahalos, Fabrizio and staff for the amazing experience!

One thing I was impressed with was that they had a pretty decent vegan option. They could do better by offering more vegan options but I must say, that the Waipio Taro Enchiladas were fantastic! They also offered a coconut based vegan ice cream which is made right here on the Big Island in Hilo. Hawaiian Licks vegan frozen desserts are amazing. So if you want great food, with a nice ambiance give Merriman's a try. I would have given them 5 stars if they had an expanded plant based menu.

291137,4,"My sister and I came in for brunch on a Saturday at around 2 (I believe brunch is until 3), and they said it would be about a 15-minute wait. We were fine with that, only when we were seated, the place was half empty so I'm not sure why they made us wait.

I ordered the Sausage Hash (pineapple sausage, onions and potatoes, served with two Eggs ""any style""). I was a little iffy about the pineapple sausage because I'm not normally a fan of anything with cooked pineapples in them. But I'm glad I got this. Instead of sausage with chunks of pineapple, it was more like a sausage with a nice sweetness to it. I'm not sure I really tasted any pineapple in there but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Plus the potatoes were perfectly crispy, and they give a pretty big portion.

My sister had the eggs benedict, which she said she also liked. But she enjoyed my dish too, so much so that she said she'll order that one the next time she's back.

The only thing I didn't like was that we felt kind of rushed. I understand brunch is over at 3, but they didn't have to start mopping up the place and placing chairs on the tables while we were eating. Not exactly a relaxing experience. That being said, if you do come for brunch, make sure you come earlier so that they don't try to push you out!",Moena Cafe,"['Hawaiian restaurant', 'Restaurant']",Daytime cafe offering gourmet Hawaiian-influenced meals in a modern white-accented setting.,1.0370759163327203e+20_1541452868569

291142,3,"This was a fun brunch spot in Kamakana Alii.  We had some confusion about whether or not they took reservations and the hostess never really cleared this up.
There was a short wait of about 25 minutes and the side walk outside is a pretty busy thoroughfare between the parking lot and the mall. It was a little annoying to have to constantly walk away and back as others needed to pass. Having pagers with a longer range, text messaging, or a specific waiting area would help.
Our table only had 3 chairs when the hostess took us to our table and so 1 of the 4 people awkwardly stood around until she brought another chair. There was another table with 4 chairs set up so maybe there was some sort of miscommunication?
Once all 4 of us were seated, the waitress came over almost immediately and didn't give us more than a minute to peruse the menu and asked for our drink order. She then left before asking our preferences on milk with coffee. When she returned with cream for all, 2 of us asked for alternatives for milk (which is specifically listed on the menu).

We were expecting similar clean and unique dishes at a restaurant that bore his name.  Sadly this is an Americanized restaurant.  Dishes are designed to cater the tastes of the masses.

I believe Morimoto may have a unique shop else where that focuses on his trademark clean and unique dishes.  But the Waikiki location is on part with the usual Asian style restaurants.

593120,4,"We ate at Napua pre-COVID-19.

RESTAURANT:

Location wise, Napua is one of the best on the island!  The restaurant is covered, but has a large patio and the inside can be exposed to the elements with doors around that open, weather permitting.  At the edge of the patio is a grassy lawn, which leads to the beach.  So, you can see the ocean from any table in the restaurant.  It is gorgeous and extremely picturesque.

SERVICE:

The service is fantastic.  Everyone exemplifies the aloha spirit.  During dinner service, there is often live music.

FOOD:

We ordered the octopus luau, calamari, Kaunamano Farms pork loin, and duck confit.  We had hoped to order the lamb, but they were ran out.  The octopus luau is great to look at and just as delicious to eat.  Overall, the presentation is fantastic and the food is very good.

33301,2,"I felt it was a little overpriced, but that's somewhat to be expected of resort dining.

My larger issue was that the menu didn't represent what we were served.  My wife's dish was supposed to have mushrooms and spinach. There was hardly any spinach and it had broccolini and green peppers. My dish was supposed to have local vegetables and had broccolini but also had mushrooms, which I don't consider a vegetable, and I picked the dish because it didn't list mushrooms as an ingredient.

I was also surprised that there was no option to add cheese or cracked pepper to the pasta.

That said, once we picked out what we didn't want the food tasted very good. My son's pizza was delicious.

EDIT: We got grab and go breakfast and it lowered my review. The croissant sandwich was supposed to have cheddar cheese but had american instead. Both my son and I were greatly displeased. AGAIN the menu didn't match the food delivered.  This is a MAJOR problem.

In addition, the english muffin on my wife's sandwich wasn't toasted, which is lazy and lame.",Nui Italian,['Italian restaurant'],Open air Italian dining room preparing a selection of Italian food within a resort hotel setting.,1.0839715421920815e+20_1609479907016

We had a counter seating which allowed us to watch over the food preparation and talk to the staff (which resulted in getting 2 extra deserts for free).  We ordered the chefs tasting menu. My husband had the caviar as an add-on.  Honestly I would not recommend getting the caviar - we assumed that that would mean he'd get an extra dish with caviar but instead he got it just added on top of 3 dishes, which honestly was a bit overpowering and detracted from those dishes.

204736,5,"If the inspectors of a certain tire company were to pass through Honolulu, PAI would be worth a stop. I stopped by for the Chef's Seasonal Tasting Menu, which was more of an experience than the mere consumption of quality sustenance.

Course after course of thoughtful and varied fare that wasn't overly complicated. A standout for me was the Agedashi Tofu, which had a little bit of smoked fish on top and was remarkable. The cocktails are a good choice, and I'd suggest you try kind of a omakase with their bartender. I had some drinks which were on par with the excellent food, capped off by this inventive tea cocktail which I enjoyed greatly.

The whole place is clean, impressively so. The staff are professional and highly attentive, while remaining unobtrusive. The tasting menu was a good choice, because there's so much good food that you could become paralyzed with indecision.

Aesthetics very clean, modern and borderline industrial. We were seated at the bar side and the place holders were locally sourced so that in itself is a plus. We were offered the restaurant week menu as well as the house menu. We opted for restaurant week and glad for it. The RW menu included two options for each course, a 3-course menu (see picture). The pictures say it all and likely does not do it justice. Each dish was well thought out, paired well with wine options and delectable but very filling.  My favorite was the NZ green-lipped mussel as well as the chocolate brownie. Well done, Pai Honolulu!

268211,4,"The only hotel I stayed in my whole time in Hawaii (Airbnb for the rest), for me the cost performance here was definitely lower. Definitely a good location, and big room. Included full kitchenette and separate bathroom and bedroom. I was informed at checkin there is a free shuttle to the Ala Moana Centre and towel rental for the beach, but only staying one night I did not utilize these services.

I found the air conditioning to be inadequate given the large room size. Since the unit was located in the living room area, I found the circulation did not reach the separate bedroom as much, leaving the bedroom a bit warm. Luckily the bedroom had a ceiling fan that helped, and I left the bedroom patio door open a bit as well.

Bed was nice a soft, great pillows. I was a bit disappointed there was not a TV in the bedroom, I wanted to relax after a long day in bed at night and watch TV, but unfortunately the TV was only in the living room.

The bathroom was the most dated part of the room, but was adequate, shower was hot and I liked the provided soaps and shampoo. I was a bit confused at how to turn on the shower, but it is one of those pull out knobs.

Since I took a photo tour the next day, I was able to iron my outfits I wanted to wear here beforehand, which was a plus.

So while this place has decent Thai food, it's a bit more expensive than the other place (probably because we are paying for the ambiance of eating in a restaurant whereas the other place is mostly take out), we still will consider this place for gatherings.

The fried chicken here is just so good.  I don't know what it is about it.  It has a nice batter on it that's not too overpowering, and the chicken is always juicy.  The calamari is the best I've had anywhere in Hawaii so far.  The breading is minimal but the calamari itself is always perfect.

The only issue we ran into was that it was raining and VERY windy for one night (who knew it rained in Maui?!) and their side door was open. Our table was right in the walkway (no problem with the location of it) and my hair was blowing everywhere from the door being open and it was freezing. Guests at other tables not even directly hit by it were complaining amongst one another. We asked the waiter if they could close that and while we didn't see him as the manager, he told us she had said no.

So the ambiance is -- almost -- first rate.  The service IS top notch.

But the food is just on the high side of so-so.   And that, after all, is why you go to a restaurant, isn't it?

So overall, Pulehu is better than its food.

The prices though, are what you'd expect from a high-end hotel restaurant, so the value just isn't there.

As for that recommendation for the canonical friend, I seldom choose hotel restaurants, and I only recommend them when they are truly outstanding.","Pulehu, An Italian Grill","['Italian restaurant', 'Bar', 'Restaurant']","Classic Italian dishes with an island twist served in a rustic-chic, open-air space at the Westin.",1.0560792346392055e+20_1544291197241

My wife was curious about a certain watch and was asking Erin if she had any display models she could look at. Erin didn't seem eager to assist my wife. I've seen graveyard robbers more eager to dig up a dead body. She started to ask personal questions such as what kind of Rolex do you own, where did you move from and what do you do for a living.

The sweet potato gnocchi and ragout was amazing a great balance of sweet and savory acidic. The steak and tempura lobster tail was sublime. Make sure to get the black barrel if you get a steak because it's like Angel's wings.
Finished off our dinner with a mango cheesecake which was light and fluffy. It had a sour cream tang to match the mango and while I'm usually strictly a thick dense  New York kinda gal, I have 0 complaints about this one.
I am a cat person and it was fun to have a bottle brush tabby roaming the area and the servers were pretty jovial about having it there.

Favorites are salted fish fried rice, mapo tofu, eggplant with minced pork, garlic chicken over cake noodle, black bean clams, salt and pepper dished (port chops, chicken or squid all tasty).  Staff has been really friendly and helpful but speaking Chinese probably helps the cause but our friends who don't speak still get good service.  Ever since portions got really small and Wah Kung in the old 99 ranch complex changed ownership, we have been coming here.

Like many Starbucks, they are consistent, the staff was quite nice and the place was relatively always a nice and clean Starbucks.  This place will even brew you a fresh cup of Kona coffee for any of you coffee connoisseurs out there reading this.

Overall, it has pretty much anything you would expect in a Starbucks.  The prices are not any different compared to what we've paid in Portland, Oregon.  The only drawback, if any, would be there are no bathrooms.  Regardless, you should be there for the coffee and not the toilets.

It took a good 20 minutes to get our food and we were the only customers there at the time, not a big deal just seemed a little abnormal.  The real issues are one burger had a hair on it (took it back they made another right away), ordered a makena burger and they didn't put the pineapple, and all of our burgers were overcooked.  The fries and chicken tenders were decent but nothing mind blowing.  I expected this to be the cool cats of Kihei but came away disappointed.

The bathroom was rather nasty clearly they're not spending any money there. The bulgogi and B-bop was flavorful...however all the other meats lacked seasoning and was bland. Looks like they were understaffed when I went and service was a okay given the lack of staff members. Expect to shower after you leave. We both woke up the next morning with sore throats from all the excessive smoke inside. FYI you will need to launder your clothes after you leave .

519452,2,"Very mediocre sushi at best. Coming from Colorado I expected the sushi in Hawaii to be the freshest, most flavorful sushi I have ever eaten. I was let down. I only ordered 3 sushi rolls. 2 if which were very basic. Spicy tuna and a rainbow roll. The 3rd was something that I picked which was supposedly a specialty roll which tasted like overcooked salmon with a nasty aftertaste. The spicy tuna was horrible until I pulled out the thin slices of carrot which they either soaked in some type of pickling solution or was rotted. After taking the carrot out the roll was eat able but with very little flavor. The rainbow roll was the only roll that had a decent taste but was still so bland that I had to soy sauce the thing to meet half of my expectation. I'm so disgusted with sushi on this island that I refuse to eat any more until I get back to Denver. Hard to believe that Colorado has superior sushi but it definitely does.

711018,5,"I had been searching for a Thai restaurant on Oahu that not only had Massaman Curry, but which could do it well. I've found that place. Thai Bistro Suksabay was a cozy restaurant with a comfortable interior. Their table settings were in line with what I've come to expect from Thai restaurants; crystal glasses and table clothes under a thick plastic protector. Their food was well priced for the quality, with a quantity that more than satisfied. The Massaman Curry and their rice is all that I am able to speak for, but considering the fluffy, perfectly cooked jasmine rice and their well spiced and peanutty Massaman, I'm sure to come back the next time a craving for Thai comes on.

307948,4,"Was in the mood for something spicy and nothing I had already been to seemed appealing and then I remembered passing by this place a few time and figured I would give it a chance.  Good call.  The food was amazing and totally hit the spot for both my craving of spicy food as well as my hunger.

Since it was just myself, I stuck to just one dish.  Got the Fried Fish with Red Curry Sauce.  Unfortunately, the brown Jasmin rice was not ready yet, so I got the regular Jasmin rice.  Still good all the same, but just wanted the healthier option.  The dish was great.  It was a perfect balance of fish, vegetables, and curry sauce.  I also like it spicy, so when I requested Thai hot, it came out hot!

To go with this flavor bomb of a dish, I got their Thai Iced Tea.  It was perfectly prepared with the right amount of tea and not to much condensed milk. Had a gentle sweetness and the tea made for a perfect combination to cleanse the palate after the zesty curry.

Service was very friendly and attentive.  Atmosphere was the typical South East Asian fare and very cozy.  It seemed very popular since I did arrive at about 11:30am and it started to get very busy shortly after I sat down and ordered.

I want to go back and try it again, but not alone so that I can try more dishes and do it family style.  If you ask if I recommend this place, the answer is yes. Go check it out.

387130,3,"We eat a lot of Thai food, and the flavors seem pretty consistent and vary only a little from restaurant to restaurant.  Maybe this Thai place is from a different region of Thailand, but the flavors were just not right.  The Tom Ka Gai missed those unique flavors that really make it Tomorrow Ka Gai.

147897,3,This is a cute little restaurant that we found while walking around Maui Mall looking for inspiration.  My boyfriend wanted to just eat at Subway so he went to get his sandwich and I went for some Thai to-go.  I wasn't feeling super hungry but knew I'd want some nice Thai leftovers so I ordered the Spring Rolls and the Pad Thai noodles.  They were soooo good and fresh tasting I was in heaven!  I thought the Spring Rolls would be deep fried like I'm used to but they were actually just wrapped in rice paper that was thin and soft.  It really makes the Spring Rolls less heavy and more flavorful when you dip it in the peanut sauce.,Thailand Cuisine 2,"['Thai restaurant', 'Asian restaurant', 'Restaurant', 'Southeast Asian restaurant']","Down-to-earth restaurant serving a range of classic Thai dishes, including vegetarian options.",1.0564479622075995e+20_1496965598334

638437,4,"This bar has a jazz New Orleans feel to it and the location makes you feel like you're in an exclusive bar upstairs away from the street. If you come at the right time you can see the live band play some great music while you relax with your friends. When there is a band make sure to bring something for them. The bar has a cover charge when a live band is playing. Its not a lot and its supporting the local talent.

A few negatives though. The bar is upstairs so that hinders handy capable people or people not very good with stairs. The bathrooms are small and only meant for one person at a time. Male and female bathrooms. If you want or care about beer on tap, they don't have any. But they do have bottles and an good assortment of liquors.

Both a negative and a positive, there is a good amount of parking down the street. but it is paid parking. So keep that in your budget or get a ride.

But I would definitely recommend this bar. But I like the grunge New Orleans look.

Sure, but if you want it done right where the flavors are well balanced (not too salty, sweet nor sour), the fish texture is perfectly tender, the bones are completely cleaned out, and they add a light bed of black rice and sweet potato and wasabi sauce to decorate and supplement the flavors beside the main, then the price is right (it's actually a bargain if you consider their consistency and precision). I went there for dinner and they were busy and I could hear some of the chaos.  But, I was not in a rush and from sit down to departure was 1.5 hours.

We had the red snapper and the mahi mahi.  The mahi mahi came out as sword fish. We were not told until it came to our table. We should have been told that when we ordered.

Our fish was very bland in the beginning and slightly overcooked but as the meal went on, both fish took the flavors to the accompanied foods, making the fish taste better and better until the last bite.

For dessert, we had the lava cake.  Great way to end a lighter fish meal.

RATS!   Rats!  rats!

Running wild!  in the Storage Area of the kitchen where are the plates, silverware, cups and cooking pans are kept.

Personally I was a huge fan of Treetops Restaurant and LOVE the location.

But after ""The New Management"" took over this year, its clear to see they have it all wrong.

RATS!

From the 7 balconies, Especially in the Storage Area behind the kitchen where are the plates, silverware, cups and cooking pans are kept.

They do not have a front door to the restaurant, just a roll up gate.  (They were advised to put a door and screens on to enclose the entire restaurant, but they did not listen).

This means rats, bugs, birds and anything that can fit can stroll on in.

Sounds harsh I know, but I have seen them with My Own Eyes on many occasions.

You can see the traces of them... small brown droppings.

And have taken pictures of them.... Gray Hair small eyes.

Think of it, the restaurant is in the Rain Forest, with no door and missing screen on the windows....

I hate to mention all that.

Some pleasant servers who care about their jobs, but the food and environment is lacking quality control.

I am contacting the Health Inspector so they will hopefully clean up their act.

Too bad, I love the location, but not the infestation of Rats!",Treetops Restaurant,['Restaurant'],Traditional Asian-inspired buffet in a light-filled food hall with a canopy view of the rainforest.,1.0208209626208199e+20_1436568481445

We were arriving a little later in the evening and when we called to make reservations we asked if they'd be running out of food. They said they wouldn't. But low and behold, when we placed our order for the appetizer they said they were out of one of the only items we were interested in. Eventually they managed to find enough ingredients to make one for us...but it was an annoying situation since we had asked when we called. We tried their seafood pancake (delicious) and then their bao buns (fine). We had several sets of nigiri sushi which honestly were not that impressive. We ordered an uzu flavored dessert which was thoroughly enjoyed and a chocolate souffle--a highlight. However, our biggest complaints were the wide variances in portion sizes. The pancake was huge, only one bao bun for an expensive price, the yuzu dessert tiny, and the souffle enormous. You would never be able to predict if you could split something or needed to purchase two to enjoy. The service was also slow. We continued to place more food orders as we progressed through dinner and we were often waiting around for our waitress to come back.

While not as famous as the USS Arizona or USS Missouri, this is still an excellent memorial to visit as it is quiet, out of the way and not as trafficked. The memorial is nice, well done and it is customary to leave a coin when you visit (I suggest you do).

As opposed to the Arizona, there is more left of the ship to see. It is the rusted, hulking underside of the ship. You can see it rusting away but you can also see where cuts were made to (try to) extract Sailors and Marines. Please visit but be mindful as this is the resting place for the dead.

There are several lookouts, and you'll be tempted to stop at every single one of them. The road eventually ends at the Kalalau valley lookout.

The tour space is very limited, so it is a good idea to plan in advance.  You can easily book online to confirm available space.  Again, it is free, so this is a no lose deal.  The docents take you back in time to really help you understand everything about the property and events that have happened over time.

Being located next to the State Capital, Iolani Palace, and State Art Museum, you can make a day of it just touring Hawaii's history in one walkable area.

Ordered the loco moco - since when did loco moco come out on a sizzling platter?? I thought I ordered loco moco - not freakin' fajitas! Seriously.... stop. Go to any Aunty's house and ask for your loco moco on a sizzling platter and let's see what happens..... you all know you're going to get a slippah' up the okole. Since when did loco moco cost 16.00?? Are you serious? Oh, and since when did loco moco come out with eggs over hard? Used to come here and aunty would come over and greet you. Now some lady with a southern accent is telling people to wait because she doesn't want to push two tables together for a big group - how's that for some aloha spirit?  Wife orders a plate that is supposed to have shoyu chicken and short ribs on it. Even this haole knows what the difference between teriyaki chicken and shoyu chicken is - they sent out okay at best teriyaki chicken - not shoyu chicken. Oh, and short ribs?? Yeah... it was A short rib as in singular.... a SINGULAR short rib... cut in half. I understand higher prices - it is Hawaii and some stuff just costs more, but for loco moco to go from 9.00 - 16.00 in less than 6 months time ann a single cut in half rib for short ribs and somehow trying to fake teriyaki chicken for shoyu chicken?

RESTAURANT:

Alan Wong's is in a surprising location.  It is on the third floor of what seems like a small office building.  However, the restaurant is very nice inside.

SERVICE:

The service is some of the best on the island.  I rarely could take two sips of water without my glass being refilled!

FOOD:

We ordered the whole tomato salad, Kauai shrimp ""escargot style,"" da bag, seared day boat scallops risotto, and the coconut.  The tomato salad is one of my favorite tomato salads, anywhere!  The escargot style is a unique way to eat shrimp.  Da bag arrives at the table as puffed up tin foil over the bowl.  The server then opens the tin foil to release the steam and expose the clams and kalua pig.  The coconut presentation is beautiful and the dish itself is extremely refreshing.

We had been here 5 years ago and I enjoyed an incredible elk burger, but they were out this time, but to my pleasure, enjoyed a venison hamburger steak.  To me honest, I regretted not getting it as a burger, but it enjoyed it all the same.  They grill up a generously sized venison patty cooked perfectly at medium rare.

I was also very pleased with their version of macaroni salad.  It was the normal bland mayo, pasta, and a few shreds of carrot.  It was a tasty and well prepared salad side that went well with the meat.

There was also a lilikoi cheesecake bar that was very good.  They don't make it themselves, but it is from friends of the owners, so all local.

After you grab a bite, walk across the street to MauiWine and enjoy some local spirits.  If you arrive at 1:30pm, there is a walking tour of this historic estate that is very nice and informative.
