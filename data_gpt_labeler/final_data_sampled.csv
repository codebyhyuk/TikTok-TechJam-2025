809810,4,"Been here twice before, (every time) we visit Honolulu.
This visit was disappointing.
Other Patrons have voiced their displeasure, you would expect more from ""A Famed"" Restaurant such as this, perhaps Mr. Wong is someplace else and has allowed this to be managed by someone else.
A bottle of wine should be served at a proper temperature right. When the wine was poured for tasting the glass frosted over. It was a Cabernet Sauvignon 2012. Upon asking the ""Somm"" if he thought it might be a good idea to decant it to allow it to breath and hopefully encourage it to warm to a reasonable drinking temperature he said oh no it'll be fine in a few minutes. we had an hour and a half for dinner (another disappointment). After 25 minutes we haven't touched the wine, the glass remains frosted, so I insisted on a decanter to move things along.
We ordered  two small plates to which they said they could produce without onions, since when is a Poke not made from scratch, I had it last year same place and it was not a problem. Same thing with dinner plates, I had to select out of a small menu the least thing I wanted because they could not accommodate no onion request. I'm a reasonable person, I know somethings you simply can not remove or make without onions. I had to settle for something simple and not exactly satisfying.
Maybe it was just this night, but for me I'm only there twice a year and I won't waste my time going there again. There are other places to dine at that do cater to my likes.  Le Mer, Morimoto Asia, Hoku's at the Kahala Resort had absolutely no problem preparing, adjusting to no onions.",Alan Wong's Honolulu,"['Pacific Rim restaurant', 'Fine dining restaurant', 'Hawaiian restaurant', 'Restaurant']","Famed chef Alan Wong presents his innovative, colorful Hawaiian fare in an upscale, 3rd-floor space.",1.1454021864925538e+20_1541730284093

Aloha Tower was once the tallest building in Hawaii; although eclipsed by the skyscrapers downtown, the position of the observation deck still offers a lovely view of the harbor and buildings around. One of the best things: it's one of the only tourist destinations that's FREE.  Take the elevator to the top floor for picture opportunities in four directions.  One can see Diamond Head and Waikiki; downtown and mauka; the harbor and mountains; and nicest of all, out to the ocean.  It's also a fun place to watch planes take off at the airport, especially the fighter jets who clearly love their jobs.

My vegetarian friends were visiting from the mainland and we decided Arancino would be the right place for us. I like this area of Waikiki because the restaurant is on a short side street and you don't have to drive deep in the mix. The restaurant offers validated parking in the Bank of Hawaii lot which is perfect since i drive a tank and the lot has wide-enough stalls.

The restaurant doesn't take reservations and I knew there would be a wait so our party agreed on meeting early - we got there at about 5:45 and were seated by 6:30. We could've maybe grabbed a quick drink at Yardhouse but instead, we decided to kill time with a leisurely walk around the block and popped into a couple stores on Lewers St. When we made it back, we waited only about 10 minutes and our party was ready to be seated.
My BF and I split the spaghetti con tobiko e calamari and pizza peperoni e salsiccia.Both were fantastic! I loved the crunch the tobiko added to the dish, and the pizza crust was beautifully crispy.

Our table finished by sharing the panna cotta which was the happy ending to a perfect meal with friends. Vegetarians and Meat Lovers were both satisfied.",Arancino on Beachwalk,['Italian restaurant'],cozy Italian pizza and pastas,1.1693266917514527e+20_1487492842369

407529,5,"One of the best small coffee shops in Honolulu. Aussie-owned (""arvo"", get it? Except they are open in the mornings), so yes, you CAN get vegemite toast here.

Accept credit cards using Foursquare.

Fresh ingredients, as locally sourced as possible.

Lovely outdoor seating. Very limited indoor seating. Shares a space with the Paiko flower shop. Often a line starting around 10 o'clock, so get there early if you can.

Definitely spring for the loaded avocado toast, the smoked salmon toast, the lavender latte. It might seem pricey for toast, but no, it's not just toast. Food quality is good, shop is clean, and portions of higher-priced items are generous. Expect the full quarter pound or so of very decent quality smoked salmon on your salmon toast. Food is served on wooden planks, so um, those capers? Yeah, they'll roll, so be prepared to lose a few or grab a fork and knife at the front. Edible flowers garnish most dishes. Beautiful presentation, though often very messy. Order inside, get your table marker, grab an outdoor table, and they will bring the food out to you. Grab extra napkins at the front or bring your own small bag of hand wipes. You'll need them.

Cuppa comes with coffee art, but not obnoxious or interferes with the flavor. Matcha latte is very strong here. If you're looking for a watered-down Starbucks version, go there. They do slow cold filtered coffee here that is very very good.",Arvo Cafe,"['Coffee shop', 'Brunch restaurant']","Hip, plant-filled coffee shop offering light fare such as toast with unique toppings.",1.025263459229875e+20_1483735248948

As we waited for our food, the restaurant became busier, but there wasn't a line of people waiting outside like I remember.  I have mixed feelings about this place because some things were good, some okay and something's they need to work on.

Good!
The bread is wonderful!
Meat sauce is tasty
Yummy cheesecake!

Okay:
Sausage
Spaghetti noodles...not quite aldente, but not overcooked

Angel hair pasta was overcooked

731828,2,"Tldr:  It's almost as good as you'll find on the island and no better or worse than Jose's. They both have their, um, charms.

The chips were passable, light, fresh, not greasy but served in 4 oz baskets, with small amounts of blended salsa and slow on the refills. Guacamole was large chunks of avocado, good, but not guac. Rice tasted like plain boiled, with not much more color. Salsa and sauces were all mild and the only peppers were Thai chilis, with not a serrano, jalapeno or habanero to be had.

Carnitas were a few slices of thick, well seared and good pork, but none of the seasoning that makes carnitas right. Veggie chimichanga was not  good as those, you might have a little better luck with the pork tamales but save the buck fifty on the mole unless you love canned. It might be made there but it's tough to tell.

335748,2,Our dinning experience was ruined by our server.  He was very pushy and seemed not very happy when we did not order alcoholic drinks.  When asked him about ingredients in certain dishes he had a very rude response and almost annoyed that we were asking.  We ask because my daughter had food allergies.  On top of this I had a cockroach run over my foot while eating..  When we brought it up to the server he just brushed it off.  Only another server came over with a broom and bin and tried to catch it and take it away.  We were guest at the Grand Wailea and we really tried not to let this experience take away from the resort.  The food was good and we really have no complaints.  We just expected so much more being an on site restaurant at the Grand Wailea.  Tip: If you come eat here around 5-6 pm you can catch the beautiful sunset from this restaurant which has an amazing view.  The service is exceptional at the resort  and we had nothing but really amazing staff during our stay.

Pick any type of pasta with any type of sauce and meats or vegetarian style. The service is fast and you usually can't finish your salad before your main dish arrives. And when it arrives, it arrives very hot. Leave room for their delicious desserts. I usually eat too much food so I eat the sorbet dessert which reduces the bloat feeling. The prices are very reasonable for what you get. Lots of seating but again the place fills up. Even though the wait isn't that long.

The for experienced: I've done all of their rooms now and would only recommend one of them to a friend (Y2K). The other rooms had broken or missing clues. We tried to challenge a couple we know but when we did the same room an entire set of clues was left out. If you're bored and really need a scratch your escape room itch give it a go. If you can wait, if definitely wait.

Plus side: they let you book private rooms for a small fee for each person. Not bad when you want to do it with only two people for the challenge.

It is perhaps unfair to mention names because EVERY person in the boutique must and should be recognized for excellent service. Even after the transaction was complete they took an equal amount of time to make sure the purchase was beautifully wrapped fit for presentation to royalty. Even as I was about to depart they wisely  shared with me new fragrances released on Saturday August 15th. I highly recommend you take time for indulgence in yourself. Take time to treat someone regardless if it's you or a loved one something wonderful from this boutique. Go there and indulge yourself. You deserve that. Stay safe. Aloha. Douglas

Let me tell you, I literally looked like a homeless person, just got off a plane rolled into here after trekking all over the beach, had a hole in my shirt and dirt on my jean shorts and she greeted me like I was the queen on England with a friendly smile and no uppity attitude like most other sales people at Chanel. Usually when I walk into Chanel looking like I did, no one offers to help me unless I ask and even then they usually reluctantly help me or not so nicely tell me I probably can't afford it.

She not only made me feel comfortable but also went out of her way to look for a limited run bag I've been looking for everywhere in NYC. I honestly can't say enough NCOs things about her and this store.

---------------------------------

2 stars.  Food here is yucky to the point of inedible. Pastry is okay and drinks are good here.

Ordered a plate lunch with mushroom and chicken.  The chicken was meh and I really liked the mushrooms but the rice had hard bits mixed in like left over from the night before.  Shame on them, can't get decent rice here. In the trash it goes.

Ordered pizza with a custard drink.  I loved the drink but the pizza was the saltiest thing ever.  I thought cook was having an off day so I gave it another chance.  I  ordered pizza again for lunch  but requested ""no salt"".  The second time was even saltier. Yuck!  Zero stars , trash can buddy.

I think getting sugary donuts are okay but stay away from the other foods they offer.  I would strongly recommend you eat dinner and lunch elseware.

I dont know if they were rushing to get us out, but I did put in a RSVP for 8pm. The seasoning was on only on the crab legs, it looked like they dumped it on and didnt even mix the bag well enough. We got combo 4 which had a little bit of each crawfish, shrimp, crab legs, sausage, corn, and potato. We also ordered the appetizer combo that had fried corn nuggets, onion rings, and cheese curds. I was surprised they had cheese curds. I'm open to trying it again and see if it was just not a good time.

The waters were blue and beautiful and very calm to snorkel in. We were told that if you go on an overcast day (like we did) you will see more fish.

The entire staff is warm and friendly.  You can tell that they all pride themselves on customer service!

We were lucky enough to meet the chef who is nothing short of amazing!

The prices are higher here than most places but you are paying for an experience.  I can tell you it is well worth every penny you spend as the food is so fantastic that I find it hard to provide words to explain it.

545777,5,"M by Chef Mavro is supposed to be a brasserie... it is less formal than Chef Mavro but I think it's an Asian-influenced take on a brasserie. We began with glasses of Champagne and the Wagyu tartare and charcuterie for 2. The charcuterie was a visual and taste delight; a meal in itself. The tartare was served with delicate chips to use as serving vessels. We would have preferred a raw quail egg as the tartare needed a touch more moisture.  We ordered the American Wagyu and the catch of the day (Ono) for our entrees, accompanied by a glass of pinot noir for the steak and a white with the Ono. Both entrees were visual and taste delights. Service was unobtrusive but attentive. All in all, a great meal at a reasonable price point.

Easy access right off king st is the awe inspiring Chef Mavro. Fresh top notch ingredients combined with true mastery and thoughtful execution. Simple and beautiful decor. It is expensive, but so is a Lamborghini and IT IS WORTH IT.
We had 9 courses and this was the food that must only had originally been served in heaven and like other mythic wonders, man stole them from the gods and brought them to share with mortal kind.

The elysian lamb is worth waging wars over. Hand raised lamb like wagyu are, the meticulous process yields only the finest result. With coconut and date chutneys, the sweet notes sing clearly while the parsnips vadouvan curry and essence of cilantro bring balance and poise to prevent oversweetness.

An epic ballad could be written for each course, from diver scallops to honeydew in champagne gelee.

545803,5,"When it comes to finding a spectacular place to dine in Hawaii, you have no shortage of local restaurants willing to cater to your needs.  If you are anything like me you are willing to search for that special place to convey the emotion you feel for the person or people you choose to dine with.

My sisters birthday is a special moment for me and my family so I wanted to ensure she felt like a queen.  I used opentable to reserve that special table, but due to a scheduling conflict I was unable to dine on her birthday.  I placed a call to Chef Mavro  within 24 hours of my reservations and they were happy to reschedule me(FREE OF CHARGE).

My first time dining with Chef Mavro was a experience I can never forget.  On the menu for desert were small carmel candies that left an impression of perfection.  I placed a call to the restaurant to confirm if the candies could be remade.  I was placed on hold and spoke directly to Chef Mavro.  We discussed in detail the menu for the night and he suggested I stick with the assigned menu desserts.

I realized the night of the dinner I would be running late, and placed a call to the front desk to confirm they would inform my party of my tardiness.  ""Sure Giovanni we will be happy to entertain your guest, until you arrive.""  I was relieved to arrive before my guest and ensure my sister table looked ""perfect""

I chose the 6 course meal for us with the wine pairings and could not be happier with presentation.  The highlight of the night was the hand made birthday cake with a single candle.  She smiled in embarrassment but noticed the look on my face as tears  began to stream as the waiter placed a additional plate with 5 small hand made caramels with a simple note...""just for you Giovanni, thanks for coming back""

I highly recommend Chef Mavro for a unique dining experience second to none.

I ended up climbing the western most trail unknowingly and had to scale up the side of the mountain. Be careful on this hike you will be climbing on certain parts, although the easier trail has a rope for assistance, the route i choose did not.  You will be walking on a ridge and the winds can blow at times making it interesting.  Wear good shoes and take water. It is a shorter climb then others but there is a cliff you will be walking along side. The memorials are a testament to how dangerous these hikes can be.

I hate when bakeries are super stingy with any filling. My second favs are the old fashioned donuts: original, maple, and chocolate glazed. Don't bother eating anyone else's old fashions. This place has got the magic recipe. Their yeast donuts are very soft and the cinnamon crunch-- total yum. I haven't really tried their cake donuts except the red velvet and the coconut, both of which I did not particularly care for, but there are other flavors that I haven't hit yet.",Donut King,['Donut shop'],"Long-standing chain offering classic and unusually shaped donuts, plus hot dogs and milkshakes.",1.1242507156041535e+20_1619854697516

There are some ropes but some of them are so thin I couldn't imagine them helping much if it was muddy. Once up the steep part it's a fairly flat walk to the 1st pill box, the view is nice but it is slightly obstructed. To find the 2nd pill box, from the 1st pill box turn towards the Mauka and look LEFT. Walk towards the giant rocks, it won't look like a path at first but you'll see one shortly. Based on another post that helped up, follow this path but don't get sucked into the mountain side too much or you won't find it. It's not much further

The view is better here, it's not a 360 but it's a nice view of the beach below. We never made it here for sunset but feel like on a dry day this is a totally do-able hike for sunset.

1326798,5,"This restaurant is consistently  one of my favorites.  It is clean, cozy and the wait staff is very friendly and accommodating.  Ordered take out, Carne Asada, Shrimp Ceviche and a two taco along with chips and salsa.  While we were waiting on the food, I asked one of the waitresses to snap a photo as we were celebrating a special event and she happily obliged which we really appreciated because we were not seated customers.  The food was fantastic, generous portions prepared as ordered (medium rare) along with fresh salsa, pico di gallo, beans and rice.  The only thing I would wish an improvement on is putting the ceviche in a soup style container instead of a plate lunch container as the umami lime sauce ended up in the bottom of the bag.

1055321,5,"Great restaurant with live music every night! Better food and better prices than Mama's Fish House!

There's also a bagpiper on certain nights as well as a Hawaiian traditional singer who will teach the audience about Hawaiian language and songs. But that's only available on the roof deck (call the lanai) during sunset on certain days so call ahead to find out if you can sit there and if they're doing it that night.

The prices are somewhat high but the food is really good and the portions are large. If you have to choose between Fleetwood's and Mama's Fish House, for a two-person dinner date you'll probably get tastier food, larger portions, and save about a hundred bucks. It doesn't have the same ocean view that Mama's has but the sunset view is incredible especially if you're up on the deck (lanai). Both are great options I just think that there's more value at Fleetwood's.

They have interesting menu items like lobster tacos and extensive beers and cocktails. There's also live music every night on the main floor and everyone has a good seat. It's usually light jazz and not too loud in case anyone has hearing problems.",Fleetwood's on Front St.,"['Seafood restaurant', 'Bar']",Drummer Mick Fleetwood's upscale-casual American restaurant with a rooftop bar offering ocean views.,1.1698700665018638e+20_1584425418702

1055809,1,"Easily the worst meal of our entire trip. Waited 15 minutes for the waiter to come take our drink orders, then waited another twenty minutes for him to return to take our food orders. Then we waited an hour before we got our food, and it was blindingly obvious it had sat under the heat lamps for a long time. My bok choy was cold and grey, and my grilled ono smelled off. Our friends' beef Wellington special was also cold and overcooked. None of us ate more than a few bites. After delivering our meals, the waiter disappeared, and it was another twenty minutes before he came to check on our food. He seemed to be really out of it, lethargic and apathetic. All I can think is he must have been having a very bad day, because I can't imagine staying employed for long given our horrible experience. When he finally returned to ask how everything was, we gave him very blunt answers about our disappointment. To the restaurant's credit, the manager came over to apologize and we paid only for our drinks, something you can't always count on these days. We had dessert at a gelato place down the street, which ameliorated the evening.

We started with the chilled cucumber soup with goat cheese and frozen tomato puree which was something we enjoyed but probably wouldn't think to order. It definitely cooled us down. E got the duck with cannellini beans with ham which she ate to the bone, grandpa had the pink snapper, which he said was a bland fish, however he liked how the capers added such beautiful flavor with the spinach and the rest of his dish, and I had the beef filet which was more medium then medium rare, but was good because of how it was sauced and the sweet potato mash was a winner, so much so that E ate half of it and then asked is this sweet potato? Normally she avoids sweet potatoes at home. And dessert... Creme Caramel and Gateau Chocolate (sp?) were perfect.

This is cash only.
Parking is super limited - park in neighborhood and walk.

We got the kalua pork and pipikaula short ribs with a small poi. Also added a laulau.

Kalua pork - smoked pork, super tender.
Pipikaula short ribs - tastes like a thicker Korean galbi, just less sweet.
Laulau - pork wrapped in leaves. Super flavorful - my favorite item.
Poi - taro smash. Was nice to try but not our favorite. It was a slight bubbly feeling on your tongue from being fermented. Not a strong flavor but wasn't a fan of the texture.
Haupia - coconut milk dessert. Tastes like coconut jello. Perfect ending to the meal.

This is the first falls, which we loved jumping and swimming in. It is freshwater. The trail is challenging to find, as it starts off the side of a residential road.

A shorter jungle hike(1 mile each way) with only a couple of steep climbs to access both waterfalls. Water shoes work best. At places the trail is muddy but not horrible. We got there at 715 and there was only one other person. We had both sets of falls to ourselves. The first set of falls was HORRENDOUS for mosquitoes, and at the second set there were none. Supposedly you can cliff jump into the first set but it looked pretty risky. The second set we swam in and there is a rope swing.(there is one dangerous boulder in the water so have someone stand by it while the other person swings in so they dont hit it) When we got back to the car at 945 the parking area was full and there were many people on the trail as we hiked out.

I like that the workshop is active and you can see live demonstrations of how they make the glass.

It's very beautiful and some of the best craftsmanship I saw.  I also so their items at the Four Seasons hotel at Wailea where I stayed where they were featured one day in the open air space and at the ferry landing the day I arrived in a few of the art galleries.

It's a complement and not a swipe at the hotel style.  We really enjoyed our stay there along with the layout, room, as well as friendly staff.

The hotel is perfect for those that want to get away, do nothing but relax.  Read a book by the pool or while take an afternoon nap in a hammock are about the most lively things going on there except for the chickens on the property.  The rooms are clean and have just the right immensities to make for a comfortable stay.

There is a restaurant on the property that serves lunch and dinner, but only does breakfast on the weekends.  There is also a bar attached to the restaurant if you want to sit and relax before dinner.  I highly recommend making reservations for dinner as it does get busy and seating is limited.

At first, they looked good, but then my wife noticed that her chicken was RAW. Yes, totally RAW in the middle. Cold and pink. And my wife had already taken a bite of it.

They were apologetic brought us a new one, but that's tough to get over.  Ultimately, the server, who was fantastic, did comp us the sesame noodles for our trouble, which was nice. But I wondered if it would have been more fair if they comped us the chicken, which was twice as expensive.

And, to top it off, turns out the table was dirty and stained my pants. Sigh.

As someone uncomfortable with heights (I can barely do bridges or balconies, let alone overlooking huge drops into rainforest), the in-depth explanation of the safety mechanics was reassuring and the harness itself felt secure.

This was an all you can eat sushi option with plenty of tasty choices.  Just keep in mind that you need to make a reservation before going.

The parking isn't great and the bathrooms are single stall bathrooms. The inside is a bit cramped but they use the lanai in the front of the building and the hallway next to it for overflow. We sat inside and I'm grateful for that the hallway seemed stuffy and the outside lanai lacked lighting.

1170309,3,"I might be a little tougher with this review because I had high expectations. It's a five course menu that is served on communal tables. The atmosphere is great, it's fun meeting new people, but it is very close to the highway and its associate noise. The initial plates were great, full of flavours and beautifully presented. But then came the salad which I think needed something other than just lettuce.. for the main, the meatball lacked seasoning and was bland. As for the dessert, the chocolate was gritty, which means powdered chocolate was used unfortunately. The menu does change very often and they do try to source everything from the island which is great. I would certainly give it another shot.",Kauai Ono,"['Restaurant', 'Hawaiian restaurant']","Unique outdoor venue with rustic communal tables for set five-course, farm-to-fork meals.

My son and I sat without a drink for most of the time, and our waitress only came twice to see what we wanted to order that wasnt on the Conyer belt, and once we had to walk over to the waiter. The calamari was so dry and salty that in was almost inedible, but we ate it because they charge per plate of food left over, on top of the 45.00 per person. My daughter and I wanted cheesecake, we were brought out two nearly frozen pieces. I sliced mine thinly myself to even be able to eat it.

918963,5,"Writing this review is brings back such fond memories of my trip to Hawaii, especially this place since I was so close. This was one of the first places I went to and was actually the last place I came to for a final taste of Hawaii to end my trip. It was everything I could have ever hoped for and more. The first time I walked in, I was greeted so kindly and they were not hesitant to have us try some samples. In my opinion, the way to go is the guava chicken and kalbi mixed plate. It was outstanding and I really wish I had more of it. Luckily, they are very generous with the portion so you will be full. Also a good thing to note is to grab a bunch of the guava sauce! Absolutely delicious. It can get very busy because of the lunch rush from the nearby army base so be sure to plan out a good time to come.

703448,1,Worked here before not a place you wanna get food from. Ask to see the back room yikes. Alot of big roaches there sometimes you can see it running around. The fish is frozen comes in a bag. Nachos chips are not fresh. They re heat it in a microwave. I was cheated out of my tips every night. I was never given a shirt for work. Plus I got sick and was fired for calling in. I also was offered to smoke drugs in the back with the boys on my 2nd day of work. They took all my tips money and I never got one dime or penny. Not a place I'd support. Lunch was never offered to me to eat for lunch as an employee meal. I sat there watch my co workers eat and never bother to ask if I wanted something to eat or drink! I think I didn't deserve to have been fired. The people there are lazy. I never had a interview I sat there for an hour then was told you do this you do that put that there that goes here and there and that was it. I never knew who my boss was. I was fired by text message and it was not sent to me it was sent to a 3rd party. Someone else had to tell me I no longer work there. So unprofessional. They steal my tips. They need to rehire the whole place. Maybe that's why they lost thousands of dollars last year. Better check your employees bank accounts. All in all I worked there and never got to try one chip. Still to this day I have never had there food.,KillerTacos,['Taco restaurant'],"Counter-serve spot offering a concise menu of Mexican favorites for dine-in, takeout or delivery.",1.0485809361645319e+20_1548815258734

181529,5,"If you are tired of Pho, you have to try King of Thai Boat Noodles for that noodle soup experience at a whole different level.

Don't get me wrong, I still love pho noodles, but it is kind of the same after a while. Thai boat noodles offer richer soup bases and more varieties of noodle choices to change it up from the simplicity of pho noodle soups.

The Combination Beef Noodle Soup offers a rich and spicy dark broth loaded with hearty chunks of different beef. It is truly filling and satisfying, so you won't be hungry for a while.

For something way different, there is the Yen Ta Fo Noodle Soup. It offers lots of seafood in a red bean based broth that is impossible to describe, but something you must try. I am not sure if it is for everyone and probably need to be in the mood for it, but very good all the same.

The Crab Meat Fried Rice is a great dish to share. It has lots of crab meat that has been perfectly fried with onions in the rice. Simple on the ingredients, which is perfect for highlighting the crab meat flavor that comes out.

Of course they make classic Thai Green Papaya Salad, which is made fresh to order. The balance of ingredients really makes this dish a perfect starter or side with you order.

The place is very clean and well lighted. Service was friendly and fast. Over all value of their dish prices was very good and well worth it.

Don't worry if you are not a fan of hot food, they do have mild curries to choose from.  Also, being Indian food, there are lots of vegetarian options for those living on a plant based diet.

For me, it has got to have meat and be spicy.  I zeroed in on the Pepper Chicken and Lamb Tikka Masala. Wow, both were over the top with great spices and preparation.  The yellow rice was a nice compliment for the curries, but if you want brown rice, they got that as well.

They have a few other items other then curry to complete or make your meal and I really enjoyed my homemade Ginger Lemonade that I got to wash down the spice with. Really was perfect to cleanse the palate after such a flavor extravaganza.

404509,4,"After reading a few less than flattering reviews, I have to say I was a bit nervous about my stay at the Kuhio Banyan Club. However,  my concerns were for naught, I had a great time! Upon initial entry to the room, it was fairly clean and well presented. The full kitchenette was a big plus, even if it was just utilised for preparing basic meals and snacks. While the building itself was a bit dated, it certainly didn't bother me. Especially for the cheap price. We were also in need of early checkout due to our flight, and this was accommodated easily.

In short, the location is fantastic, the service good, and the price wonderful. If you can handle not being in a 5-star resort, then the Kuhio Banyan Club is definitely a worthy place to consider, particularly if you're trying to holiday on the cheap.",Kuhio Banyan Club,['Hotel'],Straightforward rooms with kitchenettes in an no-nonsense hotel offering beach gear.,1.1327770527477654e+20_1475454359020

The room is a very nice size. Great location. The problem is literally EVERYTHING else. The room is hot because the AC is blocked by random wood panels which is used to cover the bed when it is folded away.

The furniture is way out dated. There's a stereo system from the 80s. The TV is about 19 inch and also blocked by the hide-a-bed wood panels. The ceiling fan is noisy and rattles. The room remains HOT despite AC being on full blast.

It's a little bit hard to find if you are driving, its not well marked by signs, just a gate at a T intersection.

Be careful not to park in front of the gate, it is prohibited. The stones are about a five minute walk from the front gate. There is no staff or any real barriers to entry, you can just walk in.

Went just before sunset when there were only a few other people here.

Not long after this another one comes to join it. Was a great experience to see them in the wild. The only thing that spoilt the experience was the fun police in charge of looking after the turtles.

However, it was a convenient straight shot 25-min bus ride from our hotel in Waikiki.

A local took us here and introduced us to Livestock Tavern -- I would definitely visit again.

We had the octopus appetizer. I generally don't eat straight up squid of octopus unless it's in takoyaki or fried to a crisp in calamari so having grilled octopus was interesting.  The texture was very soft which I hear is hard to achieve with octopus.

For the main course, I had the braised short ribs which were off the charts tender and flavorful.  It's a definite reorder the next time I visit.

701084,4,"Depending on if the owner of the condo uses the on site management company, it can add to some extra stress. We had the washing machine break in the condo we rented through VRBO while we were staying there, and when we went to the management company, they wouldn't help at all. Makes sense since the owners of the condo are taking business away from the company. We had to deal with the owners on the mainland while we were stuck with a mess. They accused us of having broke their washer and dryer since it had worked for them for the five months they wee staying there.  When we finally convinced the owners that we are not idiots and their washer just broke, they finally started to work to get a repairman out.

On the plus side, owners can charge less to allow people to stay in their condo when they don't have to pay the management company.

398324,5,"One of the best dining experiences, I've ever experienced.

I haven't had any good Italian food on the island untill I ate here!

They serve complimentary fresh baked bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar

I'm not a big tomato fan, but the Bruschetta was a delicious and refreshing appetizer.

The Lobster Ravioli is a must try. It's perfectly balanced with fresh lobster and creamy white sauce.

I had the Hazelnut Ice cream for dessert and it's basically the best gelato I've ever had. Think about Nutella Icecream!

The owner Fabrizio, originally from Roma, and is one of the nicest people I've met on the island, very personable. He even escorted us out!

I highly recommend this place, and will definitely be back!

Mahalos, Fabrizio and staff for the amazing experience!

514796,5,"This place gets a 5 star for it's food alone. My family and I have been going their for years and even to their original location before this one and we have always favored their dim sum over anywhere else in town.

The quality of their dim sum far surpasses everyone else for it's freshness and preparation. It is always a good value here, so it won't bust your budget to splurge on a big meal there. They have all the classics and then some for dim sum.

My favorites and must haves are as follows: Spareribs, Siu Mai or Shumai aka Porkhash in Hawaii, Shrimp Dumplings, Steamed Look Fun, Chicken Feet Tripe, jellyfish, Fried Garlic Eggplant, and of course Egg Custard for dessert. Of course there is a full menu of Chinese classics you can order from if you need something more. We like to get a plate of Choy Sum with Oyster Sause for some veggies and sometimes some Crispy Fried Noodles with Seafood if feeling hungry.

Most of the staff have been there a long time and may seem a little rough around the edges, but they know what they are doing. In a a busy place like this, there is no time for niceties and it shouldn't be expected. I don't mean that they are rude, they are just not going to bend all over you like a fancy restaurant.

The place has seen a lot of traffic over the years and it shows it in the overall condition of the restaurant, but I feel that it is clean and never had any problems eating there. Don't let looks deceive you, because if you don't go based on this place's appearance, you will miss out on some really good dim sum.",Mei Sum Dim Sum,['Chinese restaurant'],"Chinese fixture serving up a menu of traditional dim sum in a snug, bustling setting.",1.10224932759879e+20_1616547032315

291137,4,"My sister and I came in for brunch on a Saturday at around 2 (I believe brunch is until 3), and they said it would be about a 15-minute wait. We were fine with that, only when we were seated, the place was half empty so I'm not sure why they made us wait.

I ordered the Sausage Hash (pineapple sausage, onions and potatoes, served with two Eggs ""any style""). I was a little iffy about the pineapple sausage because I'm not normally a fan of anything with cooked pineapples in them. But I'm glad I got this. Instead of sausage with chunks of pineapple, it was more like a sausage with a nice sweetness to it. I'm not sure I really tasted any pineapple in there but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Plus the potatoes were perfectly crispy, and they give a pretty big portion.

My sister had the eggs benedict, which she said she also liked. But she enjoyed my dish too, so much so that she said she'll order that one the next time she's back.

The only thing I didn't like was that we felt kind of rushed. I understand brunch is over at 3, but they didn't have to start mopping up the place and placing chairs on the tables while we were eating. Not exactly a relaxing experience.

291142,3,"This was a fun brunch spot in Kamakana Alii.  We had some confusion about whether or not they took reservations and the hostess never really cleared this up.
There was a short wait of about 25 minutes and the side walk outside is a pretty busy thoroughfare between the parking lot and the mall. It was a little annoying to have to constantly walk away and back as others needed to pass. Having pagers with a longer range, text messaging, or a specific waiting area would help.
Our table only had 3 chairs when the hostess took us to our table and so 1 of the 4 people awkwardly stood around until she brought another chair. There was another table with 4 chairs set up so maybe there was some sort of miscommunication?
Once all 4 of us were seated, the waitress came over almost immediately and didn't give us more than a minute to peruse the menu and asked for our drink order. She then left before asking our preferences on milk with coffee. When she returned with cream for all, 2 of us asked for alternatives for milk (which is specifically listed on the menu).
The food was delicious, the presentation pretty, and the menu has a nice variation for different dietary needs.

RESTAURANT:

Location wise, Napua is one of the best on the island!  The restaurant is covered, but has a large patio and the inside can be exposed to the elements with doors around that open, weather permitting.  At the edge of the patio is a grassy lawn, which leads to the beach.  So, you can see the ocean from any table in the restaurant.  It is gorgeous and extremely picturesque.

SERVICE:

The service is fantastic.  Everyone exemplifies the aloha spirit.  During dinner service, there is often live music.

FOOD:

We ordered the octopus luau, calamari, Kaunamano Farms pork loin, and duck confit.  We had hoped to order the lamb, but they were ran out.  The octopus luau is great to look at and just as delicious to eat.  Overall, the presentation is fantastic and the food is very good.

33301,2,"I felt it was a little overpriced, but that's somewhat to be expected of resort dining.

My larger issue was that the menu didn't represent what we were served.  My wife's dish was supposed to have mushrooms and spinach. There was hardly any spinach and it had broccolini and green peppers. My dish was supposed to have local vegetables and had broccolini but also had mushrooms, which I don't consider a vegetable, and I picked the dish because it didn't list mushrooms as an ingredient.

I was also surprised that there was no option to add cheese or cracked pepper to the pasta.

That said, once we picked out what we didn't want the food tasted very good. My son's pizza was delicious.

EDIT: We got grab and go breakfast and it lowered my review. The croissant sandwich was supposed to have cheddar cheese but had american instead. Both my son and I were greatly displeased. AGAIN the menu didn't match the food delivered.  This is a MAJOR problem.

In addition, the english muffin on my wife's sandwich wasn't toasted, which is lazy and lame.",Nui Italian,['Italian restaurant'],Open air Italian dining room preparing a selection of Italian food within a resort hotel setting.,1.0839715421920815e+20_1609479907016

We had a counter seating which allowed us to watch over the food preparation and talk to the staff (which resulted in getting 2 extra deserts for free).  We ordered the chefs tasting menu. My husband had the caviar as an add-on.  Honestly I would not recommend getting the caviar - we assumed that that would mean he'd get an extra dish with caviar but instead he got it just added on top of 3 dishes, which honestly was a bit overpowering and detracted from those dishes.

204727,5,"Visited Pai Honolulu for Restaurant Week (RW). Its located inside the Harbor Court building on Nimitz Blvd. It's on the smaller size of restaurants but simply inviting. Aesthetics very clean, modern and borderline industrial. We were seated at the bar side and the place holders were locally sourced so that in itself is a plus. We were offered the restaurant week menu as well as the house menu. We opted for restaurant week and glad for it. The RW menu included two options for each course, a 3-course menu (see picture). The pictures say it all and likely does not do it justice. Each dish was well thought out, paired well with wine options and delectable but very filling.  My favorite was the NZ green-lipped mussel as well as the chocolate brownie. Well done, Pai Honolulu!

268211,4,"The only hotel I stayed in my whole time in Hawaii (Airbnb for the rest), for me the cost performance here was definitely lower. Definitely a good location, and big room. Included full kitchenette and separate bathroom and bedroom. I was informed at checkin there is a free shuttle to the Ala Moana Centre and towel rental for the beach, but only staying one night I did not utilize these services.

I found the air conditioning to be inadequate given the large room size. Since the unit was located in the living room area, I found the circulation did not reach the separate bedroom as much, leaving the bedroom a bit warm. Luckily the bedroom had a ceiling fan that helped, and I left the bedroom patio door open a bit as well.

Bed was nice a soft, great pillows. I was a bit disappointed there was not a TV in the bedroom, I wanted to relax after a long day in bed at night and watch TV, but unfortunately the TV was only in the living room.

The bathroom was the most dated part of the room, but was adequate, shower was hot and I liked the provided soaps and shampoo. I was a bit confused at how to turn on the shower, but it is one of those pull out knobs.

Since I took a photo tour the next day, I was able to iron my outfits I wanted to wear here beforehand, which was a plus.

The park is very well organized and laid out to give wonderful views of the harbor both the working Naval base and historic Naval Base. The exhibits for the bowfin submarine was well laid out and organized however a few more informational kiosks would have been nice. Memorials for the Utah very well done showing a part of History that is awesome understated or over locked. The USS Missouri was a little expensive after entering the park but well worth the visit. Much history on the decks.
Inside the National Park area the theaters and museums are very informative as to the cause and started the war and what precipitated the attack on Pearl Harbor.

So while this place has decent Thai food, it's a bit more expensive than the other place (probably because we are paying for the ambiance of eating in a restaurant whereas the other place is mostly take out), we still will consider this place for gatherings.

The fried chicken here is just so good.  I don't know what it is about it.  It has a nice batter on it that's not too overpowering, and the chicken is always juicy.  The calamari is the best I've had anywhere in Hawaii so far.  The breading is minimal but the calamari itself is always perfect.

I miss the Huberts lemonade they sold at this location, but they still have fountain drinks and other bottled drinks. A must stop before a waikiki beach day or after a trip to the zoo! Definitely try this place for its inexpensive couture fares and I know you will go back! 16 years from now, you could be telling your own stories down memory lane!",Pita Pit,"['Sandwich shop', 'Caterer', 'Fast food restaurant', 'Mediterranean restaurant']",Diners create their own sandwiches at this health-oriented counter-serve chain.,1.0220169947991799e+20_1625247088577

1449943,4,"The experience at Pulehu is of an almost elegant restaurant.   It is open to the Ka'anapali beach air.  The lighting is wonderful.  The space is generous.  The glassware is fine.  But where are the tablecloths?

So the ambiance is -- almost -- first rate.  The service IS top notch.

But the food is just on the high side of so-so.   And that, after all, is why you go to a restaurant, isn't it?

So overall, Pulehu is better than its food.

The prices though, are what you'd expect from a high-end hotel restaurant, so the value just isn't there.

As for that recommendation for the canonical friend, I seldom choose hotel restaurants, and I only recommend them when they are truly outstanding.","Pulehu, An Italian Grill","['Italian restaurant', 'Bar', 'Restaurant']","Classic Italian dishes with an island twist served in a rustic-chic, open-air space at the Westin.",1.0560792346392055e+20_1544291197241

The only issue we ran into was that it was raining and VERY windy for one night (who knew it rained in Maui?!) and their side door was open. Our table was right in the walkway (no problem with the location of it) and my hair was blowing everywhere from the door being open and it was freezing. Guests at other tables not even directly hit by it were complaining amongst one another. We asked the waiter if they could close that and while we didn't see him as the manager, he told us she had said no.

This time, however, we got a 'sample' platter of two kinds of lobster rolls, as well as the Red Lobster version of poutine, clam fries. We loved all of it, sharing with my husband at our 5th wedding anniversary. I'd definitely return and gladly let people know that though its a chain, they seem to step it up a bit at Waikiki.",Red Lobster,"['Seafood restaurant', 'American restaurant', 'Angler fish restaurant', 'Bar', 'Crab house', 'Event venue', 'Family restaurant']",Lively chain restaurant serving American seafood standards amid New England-themed decor.,1.0761862953841867e+20_1536953882508

129637,2,"For me, OVERRATED restaurant!!! My husband cooks a way better steak and seafood dinner!!!!

Out of fairness to the negative tone of my review - I think providing a little more detail on my personal experience on this occasion would be fair to the restaurant.

I attended this restaurant with a group of 17 ladies.  We were seated at 2 tables next to each other with 10 ladies on one table and 7 ladies on another.

The waiter came around and took all our orders.  As the food came to the table,  there was a slight confusion on the orders.  Two people at our table got the wrong order. But instead of returning the order - they opted to eat what was in front of them to avoid waiting for their correct order to come out.

Honestly,  the original waiter returned to our table ONCE after everyone got their food.  We requested refills on water and drinks - no one came to refill our table.

The food wasn't anything different than what's served at any steakhouse.  It wasn't an experience that deserved 5 stars for the amount of monies we spent for this gathering.  I definitely voted that our group never return there. Not for the monies we paid and the lack of service we received along with the food being just ""okay.""",Ruth's Chris Steak House,"['Restaurant', 'American restaurant', 'Caterer', 'Fine dining restaurant', 'Seafood restaurant', 'Steak house']","Outpost of upmarket steakhouse chain known for sizzling, butter-topped beef in an elegant setting",1.0218819532411116e+20_1552805906074

Next day - we went back to try more food. The roasted eggplant was more onion than eggplant, so they can easily change the name or revise the amount of the eggplant.
Dynamite Axi without the sides was good.

Do not pass the signs which say do not pass this point for your safety. People have been swept down and severely injured and died when approaching the surf.

I wouldn't have a problem had he himself been wearing gloves. He touched  her cup so tell me how that differs from her touching the cup with her bare hands.  Train your your employees.  That was uncalled for all he needed to say was I am so sorry miss may we give you sweetener and that would've been way better than his oh we cannot take it back cause you touched it.

The bathroom was rather nasty clearly they're not spending any money there. The bulgogi and B-bop was flavorful...however all the other meats lacked seasoning and was bland. Looks like they were understaffed when I went and service was a okay given the lack of staff members. Expect to shower after you leave. We both woke up the next morning with sore throats from all the excessive smoke inside. FYI you will need to launder your clothes after you leave .

I only ordered 3 sushi rolls. 2 if which were very basic. Spicy tuna and a rainbow roll. The 3rd was something that I picked which was supposedly a specialty roll which tasted like overcooked salmon with a nasty aftertaste. The spicy tuna was horrible until I pulled out the thin slices of carrot which they either soaked in some type of pickling solution or was rotted. After taking the carrot out the roll was eat able but with very little flavor. The rainbow roll was the only roll that had a decent taste but was still so bland that I had to soy sauce the thing to meet half of my expectation. I'm so disgusted with sushi on this island that I refuse to eat any more until I get back to Denver. Hard to believe that Colorado has superior sushi but it definitely does.

307948,4,"Was in the mood for something spicy and nothing I had already been to seemed appealing and then I remembered passing by this place a few time and figured I would give it a chance.  Good call.  The food was amazing and totally hit the spot for both my craving of spicy food as well as my hunger.

Since it was just myself, I stuck to just one dish.  Got the Fried Fish with Red Curry Sauce.  Unfortunately, the brown Jasmin rice was not ready yet, so I got the regular Jasmin rice.  Still good all the same, but just wanted the healthier option.  The dish was great.  It was a perfect balance of fish, vegetables, and curry sauce.  I also like it spicy, so when I requested Thai hot, it came out hot!

To go with this flavor bomb of a dish, I got their Thai Iced Tea.  It was perfectly prepared with the right amount of tea and not to much condensed milk. Had a gentle sweetness and the tea made for a perfect combination to cleanse the palate after the zesty curry.

Service was very friendly and attentive.  Atmosphere was the typical South East Asian fare and very cozy.  It seemed very popular since I did arrive at about 11:30am and it started to get very busy shortly after I sat down and ordered.

I want to go back and try it again, but not alone so that I can try more dishes and do it family style.  If you ask if I recommend this place, the answer is yes. Go check it out.

The only negative thing is the parking lot.  The main parking lot in front is very busy and their underground parking is rather awkward.",Thai Lao,['Thai restaurant'],"Warm, white-tablecloth eatery offering traditional Thai standards in relaxed, strip-mall environs.",1.10224932759879e+20_1580801156227

Besides this: The hotel claims to do something good for the environment by having abonded plastic straws BUT they use plastic onetime-use cups for all cocktails on the terrace. That makes no sense at all as the amount of waste is even bigger. A quailty restaurant or bar should always serve the food and drinks on and in quality cups and plates which is defintely not plastic for me.

638437,4,"This bar has a jazz New Orleans feel to it and the location makes you feel like you're in an exclusive bar upstairs away from the street. If you come at the right time you can see the live band play some great music while you relax with your friends. When there is a band make sure to bring something for them. The bar has a cover charge when a live band is playing. Its not a lot and its supporting the local talent.

A few negatives though. The bar is upstairs so that hinders handy capable people or people not very good with stairs. The bathrooms are small and only meant for one person at a time. Male and female bathrooms. If you want or care about beer on tap, they don't have any. But they do have bottles and an good assortment of liquors.

Both a negative and a positive, there is a good amount of parking down the street. but it is paid parking. So keep that in your budget or get a ride.

But I would definitely recommend this bar. But I like the grunge New Orleans look.

All of the small dishes were amazing - so much flavour and not too heavy. We loved the combination of the beets with blue vein cheese and the chickpea patties were delicious!!
For dinner I had fish with green beans and sweet onion puree and hubby had the whole roasted moi . Both were great but my dish was superb!! The fish was cooked perfectly and was mixed with amazing flavours. The roasted moi was delicious but hubby wished he had.mine!!We also shared a couple of desserts - chocolate pie, apple tart and hubby also got the icecream sandwiches - he said this was his favourite!!
The service was very friendly and attentive with Brigette happy to accommodate and answer any questions as well as making a special cocktail not on the cocktail menu.

First. The staff is extremely friendly, helpful, and on top of everything. They dont miss a beat. Johnathan was wonderful. Even if they are busy. If you get up to walk outside for a few seconds, someone will have refolded your napkin and refilled your water in a blink. They are highly professional and make sure your needs are taken care of.
Second. The food is extraordinary! Many healthy yummy options for us vegetarians as well. The mushroom appetizer  is a must.
Third, the place is gorgeous. Wonderful experiance.old tools and props from local sugar cane plantations are all over and some pretty cool old maps are on the walls.

643812,4,"Okay, so I went with two older ladies who are Visayan and have been there apparently quite a bit. So yeah, we might have gotten more preferential service than if I went alone. But, the service was very sweet in general, even with the other tables I noticed. Biggest lure seems to be the all you can eat buffet. It's a pretty small one, though.

Lechon Kawali was bright and fresh and the skin was well rendered. Lumpia was crispy and not overly greasy; sauce was basic but a nice complement.

The Halo Halo is the size of a child's head, so be prepared to eat something very cold very quickly. Not really an individual kind of serving. Then again, maybe that's all you want for the day. In which case, yes, it's an individual serving. ;)

A pretty clean and bright, if old, establishment.

Bathroom available on site. Unisex and just the one though.

Free parking, although it gets very tight. Be prepared to park on-street in the little road in front, running parallel to Farrington Highway, during dinner hour.

Accepts credit cards.

Will return for the buffet. When I go, though, everybody always orders a la carte. Argh!",Thelma's Restaurant,"['Filipino restaurant', 'Restaurant']","Informal, family-owned restaurant specializing in Filipino fare with Hawaiian-American influences.",1.025263459229875e+20_1492386937950

We had the red snapper and the mahi mahi.  The mahi mahi came out as sword fish. We were not told until it came to our table. We should have been told that when we ordered.

Our fish was very bland in the beginning and slightly overcooked but as the meal went on, both fish took the flavors to the accompanied foods, making the fish taste better and better until the last bite.

For dessert, we had the lava cake.  Great way to end a lighter fish meal.

RATS!   Rats!  rats!

Running wild!  in the Storage Area of the kitchen where are the plates, silverware, cups and cooking pans are kept.

Personally I was a huge fan of Treetops Restaurant and LOVE the location.

But after ""The New Management"" took over this year, its clear to see they have it all wrong.

RATS!

From the 7 balconies, Especially in the Storage Area behind the kitchen where are the plates, silverware, cups and cooking pans are kept.

They do not have a front door to the restaurant, just a roll up gate.  (They were advised to put a door and screens on to enclose the entire restaurant, but they did not listen).

This means rats, bugs, birds and anything that can fit can stroll on in.

Sounds harsh I know, but I have seen them with My Own Eyes on many occasions.

You can see the traces of them... small brown droppings.

And have taken pictures of them.... Gray Hair small eyes.

Think of it, the restaurant is in the Rain Forest, with no door and missing screen on the windows....

I hate to mention all that.

Some pleasant servers who care about their jobs, but the food and environment is lacking quality control.

I am contacting the Health Inspector so they will hopefully clean up their act.

Too bad, I love the location, but not the infestation of Rats!",Treetops Restaurant,['Restaurant'],Traditional Asian-inspired buffet in a light-filled food hall with a canopy view of the rainforest.,1.0208209626208199e+20_1436568481445

We were arriving a little later in the evening and when we called to make reservations we asked if they'd be running out of food. They said they wouldn't. But low and behold, when we placed our order for the appetizer they said they were out of one of the only items we were interested in. Eventually they managed to find enough ingredients to make one for us...but it was an annoying situation since we had asked when we called. We tried their seafood pancake (delicious) and then their bao buns (fine). We had several sets of nigiri sushi which honestly were not that impressive. We ordered an uzu flavored dessert which was thoroughly enjoyed and a chocolate souffle--a highlight. However, our biggest complaints were the wide variances in portion sizes. The pancake was huge, only one bao bun for an expensive price, the yuzu dessert tiny, and the souffle enormous. You would never be able to predict if you could split something or needed to purchase two to enjoy. The service was also slow. We continued to place more food orders as we progressed through dinner and we were often waiting around for our waitress to come back.

701189,4,"After a morning visit to Haleakala National Park in the morning and a few more site seeing stops along the way Westward, this place is must do for lunch.  Their small but fantastic menu of farm fresh meats from the ranch is just amazing.

We had been here 5 years ago and I enjoyed an incredible elk burger, but they were out this time, but to my pleasure, enjoyed a venison hamburger steak.  To me honest, I regretted not getting it as a burger, but it enjoyed it all the same.  They grill up a generously sized venison patty cooked perfectly at medium rare.

I was also very pleased with their version of macaroni salad.  It was the normal bland mayo, pasta, and a few shreds of carrot.  It was a tasty and well prepared salad side that went well with the meat.

There was also a lilikoi cheesecake bar that was very good.  They don't make it themselves, but it is from friends of the owners, so all local.

After you grab a bite, walk across the street to MauiWine and enjoy some local spirits.  If you arrive at 1:30pm, there is a walking tour of this historic estate that is very nice and informative.

Dress for cool weather. Another reason to drive up early, you'll have the entire lookout for yourself, and truly great if you brought your photography gears with you. There are several lookouts, and you'll be tempted to stop at every single one of them. The road eventually ends at the Kalalau valley lookout. Yet another reason to be there early is because of visibility, try to avoid afternoon drives because the clouds descend by that time. You'll see nothing but clouds at the Niihau island lookout area.

The falls were closed to swimming when we went but no change to the entry price, they did offer a 10 day rain check if we wanted to return later which was pointless when you are only in the area for the day.

173886,5,"This place is something most people don't think of as a historical place to visit.  It is an important part of Hawaii's history leading up to modern times, but it wasn't until recent years did become open to the public for free tours every Thursday.

The tour space is very limited, so it is a good idea to plan in advance.  You can easily book online to confirm available space.  Again, it is free, so this is a no lose deal.  The docents take you back in time to really help you understand everything about the property and events that have happened over time.

Being located next to the State Capital, Iolani Palace, and State Art Museum, you can make a day of it just touring Hawaii's history in one walkable area.

I don't recommend this for young children as it will be boring for them and they will disturb others who are trying to listen to the docent.

545249,2,"The good: Food was amazing and the cost was reasonable.  I enjoyed the zucchini fries and the super Gyro. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time.

The Bad: Out of the staff only one member was personable.  Our orginal waitress seemed as through she didnt want our table.  She stated that someone else would help us then said nevermind I'll take you myself.  We started off with soft drinks, my wife drink was fine.  My lemonade came with about ""20 or more sugar ants"" floating in my cup.  I was very discreet when telling her that I had a cup full on ants.  She said Im not sure how they got there and got a new cup.  That was the last time she came to our table.

The Ugly: Even though I wasn't looking for a free handout, but it would have been a nice gesture to remove my drink from the bill.  Or at least have the manager come over to apologize for serving a cup of ANTS.  Sad part is the waitress that removed our plates and offered to show us the dessert menu was very nice.  I think the other staff can learn from her or hire more like her.

The dining area has ambience with courtyard like seating as well as bar seating inside.  Service was alittle uneven because different staff dropped by but I did not really have anyone taking care of me.

I had the pork dish which was good as was the price reasonable, but it did not fall in the fine dining category.  The dish was infused with honey but the overall taste was not very nuanced - it tasted like a barbecue rib with some added sugar.  However, Waikiki is somewhat of a food desert and this is a welcomed addition.",ZIGU,"['Authentic Japanese restaurant', 'Bar', 'Izakaya restaurant', 'Japanese restaurant']",Local ingredients are highlighted on the creative Japanese menu at this chic spot with full bar.,1.0609298356145671e+20_1567828114574

There is a huge difference between sitting inside and outside, there are only 5 tables  inside.  It's like being  quarantined. Outside is gorgeous. We watched a party of same size arrive after us be seated outside before us. Disappointing from start and never recovered. Why even make a reservation if you will be overlooked?

707479,1,"Husband and I typically frequent this location (kapolei) and order two items consistently. First the grilled salmon and the other skinnylicious medallions. This evening I had family emergency to attend to so left abruptly without my phone. My husband picked me up with our young granddaughters on his way to work. We decided to order from this location with hesitation. Past few times our order was inconsistent. However with situation at hand we really had heart set on the medallion meal. As i didn't have my phone and husband running late to work he had a coworker pick him up and left me with cash enough for the meal (medallions and cheesecake) and tip. I waited for a server over 30 minutes and asked an employee to get a server for me and he ignored me. Luckily a patron came along and helped me get a server as I had the girls sleeping in the car. Finally a server comes out with my food and I check it because past few times they have jipped me on the asparagus and I added a note on order to please put full servings of asparagus. I could not believe what I saw when I opened lid to entree, after the day I had and seeing how messed up the order was I wanted to cry so frustrated. It was smaller portion than normal, even for skinny, and if only had like 4 soggy skinny pieces of aspargus and didn't see mushrooms. It was just mush. I have seen TV dinners look better. Not to mention it was cold.Very disappoining for being expensive. I told manager and instead of being honest or valuing a repetive customer he was rude and arrogant kept claiming that's the skinny size and didn't even acknowledge how horrible it was. I truly wish I was able to take a pic of it, as my words dont properly express how horrible it was. He offered to redo it, I figured if that dish is going to be an issue try something simple like the salmon, I had already been there an hour. Then I find out its 10 dollars more, the previous order with cheesecake was 27 and then I learn it's now 35 before tip. Manager was very rude about the whole thing and besides not valuing its customers, belittling me because my husband left me with what was expected and I had no phone with me. He tried to say it was my fault for not calling and saying I was there. It does NOT say please call to let us know you're here. Also, that does not explain the poor execution of the meal.  I waited for an hour and had to leave empty handed, and feeling belittled by the managers behavior. Food was not good quality he knows it and didn't honor it. I ended up having to go to cpk where I should have gone in first place. They are consistent with food and value its customers.

Easy to walk through it with a couple spots where you need to go over some big rocks and boulders. You can tell that there is another exit at the other end by feeling the breeze hitting your face once you get inside. There are two ways at the end of the cave to make it back to the parking lot. Make sure that you follow the trail to the right. That will take you straight to the starting point. If you follow the trail towards the left, you'll basically go around and enter a neighborhood near the Kaumana Elementary School.
