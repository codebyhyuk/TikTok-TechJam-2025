30137,1,"Easily the worst meal of our entire trip. Waited 15 minutes for the waiter to come take our drink orders, then waited another twenty minutes for him to return to take our food orders. Then we waited an hour before we got our food, and it was blindingly obvious it had sat under the heat lamps for a long time. My bok choy was cold and grey, and my grilled ono smelled off. Our friends' beef Wellington special was also cold and overcooked. None of us ate more than a few bites. After delivering our meals, the waiter disappeared, and it was another twenty minutes before he came to check on our food. He seemed to be really out of it, lethargic and apathetic. All I can think is he must have been having a very bad day, because I can't imagine staying employed for long given our horrible experience. When he finally returned to ask how everything was, we gave him very blunt answers about our disappointment. To the restaurant's credit, the manager came over to apologize and we paid only for our drinks, something you can't always count on these days. We had dessert at a gelato place down the street, which ameliorated the evening.

30555,5,"This is your reward at the end of the Waimea Valley trail. If you dare, you can borrow a life jacket and swim into the falls!

Note that yes, a life jacket is mandatory to go in the water. There is a booth that a staff member will give you one for free (would recommend tipping the staff). There is also a separate booth for storing your items (costs a few dollars). There is a seating area for those who are not entering the water or parents to watch their children.

I'd recommend water shoes as well (you need to climb down some slippery and a few sharp rocks to enter the water). It's pretty cold, but you adjust in few minutes after entry. The current is a little strong swimming into the falls, but pushes you away when you are swimming back.

Also note there are warnings as to bacterias in the water, so avoid ingesting the water if possible. Really a beautiful view. It's quite cold once you exit the water and start walking back, bring a towel and an extra set of clothes if you can.

As it was a great memory for both of us we decided to return today, this time with our three-month old son in tow. We took him in a carrier on foot and did not go swimming and it was still an excellent experience. The plant life along the easy paved trail is incredible and makes for some great pictures - in particular, there are a number of exotic flowers that will be unfamiliar to anyone coming from the mainland. Some parts of the trail are uphill but in general there is plenty of shade and places to sit along the way. There are also vending machines where you can buy water near the falls and trailer bathrooms (definitely a step up from porta potties).

30920,5,"I've been looking forward to coming here for the past year!!! It was as great as it was last year!!! Loved it!
I have dreams about the taro leaf risotto and bone marrow!! Omg it is absolutely delicious!! It's huge too so can actually be an entree. We had it as a heavy appetizer!! Delicious!!
Hubby got the kalbi steak. We have heard a lot about Maui beef and it totally lived up to the expectation! It was beautifully marinated and cooked. Was so so tender and delicious! The papaya and carrot slaw with the macadamia nuts that came with it was delicious too! I had the pan seared fish which was oh so good! The fish was amberjack which I have never had before. It's white and has a mild taste. It was cooked perfectly!! Nice and crunchy on the outside and beautifully flaky and moist on the inside! The corn puree and veggies with it were delicious too.
The dessert options I wasn't crazy about. I really would have loved the lemon curd they had a year ago but alas.....We got the almond cake with coconut ice cream and toasted coconut flakes. I made sure it didn't have any almond extract which I totally abhorr! It was actually made from almond flour and was delicious!!!
I will try to come here again because there are other things on the menu I'd love to have!!",The Mill House,"['New American restaurant', 'Bar', 'Restaurant']","Sophisticated venue for refined, locally sourced New American cuisine in a picturesque setting.",1.1458935758605903e+20_1548893737298

Come dress warmer since it's much cooler temp wise in this area at night. They have since expanded to the lower level but we were able to get seats up top like before. We started of with the bone marrow which my wife enjoyed. I ordered the fish special which was really good as it was seasoned perfectly. I just wish it was bigger as I still felt hungry afterwards (I'm only 150lbs). My wife got the shrimp dish but said it lacked flavor.

We got the spaghetti with a huge meatball for the kids. This came out still a little raw in the middle and we had to get it recooked. The manager assured us it was still good and high quality beef. If it was me eating it, I'd be ok, but when it comes to our toddlers, raw meat was just not an option for us.

The service was amazing both times.
For lunch we sat at the bar and were helped by the friendly bar man - wish I asked his name - as we were still trying to understand tipping and lingo etc we just wanted something light and had a couple of light bites with a beet salad that he suggested.
All of the small dishes were amazing - so much flavour and not too heavy. We loved the combination of the beets with blue vein cheese and the chickpea patties were delicious!!
For dinner I had fish with green beans and sweet onion puree and hubby had the whole roasted moi . Both were great but my dish was superb!! The fish was cooked perfectly and was mixed with amazing flavours. The roasted moi was delicious but hubby wished he had.mine!!We also shared a couple of desserts - chocolate pie, apple tart and hubby also got the icecream sandwiches - he said this was his favourite!!

30975,4,"Dined here this evening and had a lovely experience. First, I highly recommend reserving a table ahead of time as I did, because they do get quite busy for dinner. If the weather is good be sure to ask for outside seating to enjoy the beautiful scenery!

As far as the food goes, I think my only real concern was that it was a bit bland in some parts. The croquetas had lovely, tasteful garnishes, but the insides left something to be desired. The pan seared fish was likewise absolutely lovely, but the side vegetables were severely underspiced. I understand a restaurant must accommodate all tastes though, so perhaps merely requesting some salt and pepper for the table will suffice.

As for service, the staff will definitely take care of you! As I was alone, I understand that the tip is probably not as promising as for the larger tables, so unfortunately I did seem to get passed up when the restaurant got busier. I had to ask three different people to try and get a refill on my drink, and I do have to knock a star off for that. However, the staff worked hard to correct the problem, and I got free dessert for the inconvenience.

Overall, the beautiful location, interesting menu, and dedicated staff get a high recommendation from me. I think my only suggestion would be perhaps having the wait staff responsible for less tables if they are expected to service the larger tables, as that way the smaller tables will still get their service needs met. If you are going as a group, expect a lovely experience, but if you will be dining alone or as a couple, you may encounter the same problems if you go during the peak hours.",The Mill House,"['New American restaurant', 'Bar', 'Restaurant']","Sophisticated venue for refined, locally sourced New American cuisine in a picturesque setting.",1.164498732990753e+20_1570432306219

First. The staff is extremely friendly, helpful, and on top of everything. They dont miss a beat. Johnathan was wonderful. Even if they are busy. If you get up to walk outside for a few seconds, someone will have refolded your napkin and refilled your water in a blink. They are highly professional and make sure your needs are taken care of.
Second. The food is extraordinary! Many healthy yummy options for us vegetarians as well. The mushroom appetizer  is a must.
Third, the place is gorgeous. Wonderful experiance.old tools and props from local sugar cane plantations are all over and some pretty cool old maps are on the walls.
Fourth. They are the definition of being green. They grow almost everything they serve there and have partnerships with other on island farmers for the few things they dont.",The Mill House,"['New American restaurant', 'Bar', 'Restaurant']","Sophisticated venue for refined, locally sourced New American cuisine in a picturesque setting.",1.0415459584304492e+20_1581841896087

The server then took our order, and the manager did give us appetizers as an apology. Although the manager and other wait staff were very helpful, the overall experience wasn't great.

Was given this as a suggestion by the hotel for a farm to table experience. Located in the center of the island but easy to find.

Parking was quite easy as the location has a lot near the restaurant. While walking up to the restaurant you pass by alot of the old plantation equipment rich in local history.

The food was superb we ordered both standard and special items, started with Steamed Buns, a Pork (or really fancy Spam) Mitsubi, Hamachi Collar, a chopped salad (needed some greens) , Hand Cut Pasta with Beef with an orange gelato

All of the food was simple and prepared beautifully showing the quality of ingredients and a care in the preparation.

In addition to the food, their drink menu was just as fun. Several sugar cane based drinks were consumed and overall well worth the time and price.

I didn't know that it was made with bay shrimp. I am allergic to bay shrimp. The manager Karen (?) came to our table to discuss my concern. After speaking and hearing my dilemma, she immediately took my plate and redid my plate by illuminating the shrimp and added only lobster. That is awesome customer service.

I'd go back not just for the food but for the service we received.

My family and I went on a Tuesday night so I don't believe that there should be any excuse for such slow service. It wasn't even that crowded that evening and my family and it was frustrating to sit there with empty water cups when the water station was right next to us.

When we finally got our food I honestly have to say it was delicious, but I don't think I would return to Red Lobster just for the fact service was so slow.

We kept joking about it and eventually, we were too tired to go walk or cab anywhere else so we stumbled in and I ate Red Lobster for the first time in over 20 years.

First of all, the cheesy biscuits are amazing, and I remember them fondly from 20 years ago. But 20 years ago, my dining experience was not so great so all I remember is the biscuits.

This time, however, we got a 'sample' platter of two kinds of lobster rolls, as well as the Red Lobster version of poutine, clam fries. We loved all of it, sharing with my husband at our 5th wedding anniversary.

32070,2,"Food was decent but I was expecting an eating experience. It was quickly ended by a couple of basic things. I look for a hostess to greet me with a smile and be personable (strike one), I expect the table (hair of some sort on the tablecloth) and dishes (stains or unclean dishes) to be clean when served to me (strike two and three). I expect the waiter to remember to ask how I like my steak and to take my drink order (strike four and five). The guy in charge of filling the water glasses was bombastic about it to the point I had to tell him to go away and only come back if the damn glasses were empty.

All of the above can be fixed by an easy management change or maybe a manager present. No one asked me how my experience was at the end which was the icing on the whole thing.

I'm a simple food person so there aren't as many choices for me but I found a few super delicious options even for me - the Yamma Mamma meatloaf with mashed potatoes, tempura onion rings, and some greens was delicious as you can see from my empty plate. The appetizer was Mongolian Beef wonton tacos and was amazing. The salad I got had hearty greens and a very light dressing and was okay but not my favorite salad.  The lava cake style souffle with ice cream is a must have. The service is impeccable.

When we mentioned the tarragon heavy dish they took our drinks off the bill which was nice.

The souffle was about what I expected from a chocolate lava cake. That is, it was good. The ice cream was pretty tasteless, though, and only served well as a cold offset. My wife got watermelon salad, moto rolls, and pork belly bao. They cooked the pork belly for the bao su vide.

32603,4,"Been to different Ruth Chris Steak House locations over the years and have visited this one before and never was really impressed with them before, but this visit was a much more memorable experience for both the food as well as the service.

With all the dining modifications due to COVID safety, it was far less packed in with dinners, so the service seemed much more personalized and attentive.  Even the food seemed much better than before overall.  However I was disappointed to see a reduced menu, but it is understandable given the current situation that things are back to normality yet and this is the new norm for the time being.

We got the tomahawk steak for 2 which was a great deal over all. Had plenty of leftovers that made a wonder steak salad the following day.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was very tasty.

I also enjoyed the house steak salad that came with it. It clearly wasn't your out of bag salad mix. The blue cheese dressing I requested from the options was obviously homemade with lots of chucks of strong blue cheese.

The sides were your typical mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Both were tasty, but honestly you can't go wrong with both dishes.  The dessert was a nice chocolate cake finish and I requested vanilla ice cream to go along with it to help cleans the my palate after all the richness of the meat.

The kids really enjoyed the racing, and the racing staff (two guys forgot the names) were friendly and helped the kids out as this was their first time.

The minus star comes from the arcade, if you want to call it that. Air hockey table BARELY makes the puck slide, basketball hoop had trash on it, redemption game empty, and one arcade joystick on the space game only goes left.

Although the place was crowded, someone could arguably say its because the food is delicious, its really more of a tourist trap.

Here's the thing, if you havent had any Hawaiian food before...this place can be a good beginner's restaurant, I suppose. Im just still scratching my head on how the ratings got so high from all the past reviews!

I ordered the loco moco. It was bland and my eggs were over cooked. I had slab sriracha with salt to add more flavor. My husband got the Ali'i plate. The effort was there, but just didnt cut it on the taste test. It was also bland and lacked any type of flavor. Our friend got the Aloha Mixed Plate. He also was not pleased.

The food was well cooked and well-flavored. The Ali'i Mixed Plate has something for everyone, so if you are indecisive I recommend that. The pulled pork sandwich had nice barbeque flavor and the pork was soft without being chewy.

Said it was ""okay"" but the rice ended up upsetting his stomach as the day wore on. Noteworthy also was the fact that they do not carry any jelly or jam for the toast. I kept things simple with the two eggs, Portuguese sausage, potatoes and toast. The food was cooked well enough, but the breakfast potatoes were just small red potatoes fried in batter; they were unseasoned and the result was like eating a fried baked potato. The unremarkable food was accompanied by equally unremarkable service. Our waitress was somewhat stoic which was disappointing as we watched the other waitstaff engage their customers with friendly banter.

33492,5,"Aloha Mixed Plate is conveniently located waterfront, behind the Cannery mall. It's easy to miss because you may not expect to find a gem right there, but worth looking for. The pricing is very reasonable, and the plates are delicious. It's so clean and neat it looks brand new, and it's directly on the waterfront.  Right next to a Luau venue, so you may hear some of that local music and entertainment. The plates are familiar Luau fare, and I suspect these places may be related. It's family friendly and the service is fast. They carry the Maui Brewery beers too, try the Big Swell.

33504,4,"We have no been in Maui for a few years and we were surprised to see Aloha's new look.  The restaurant looks nice and modern at the cost of a lot of the original charm.  The hostess and our server were both very friendly.

We started with a round of drinks.   I had a Mai Tai that,  while tasty,  was weak and about the size of a thimble.  My wife had the toasted coconut drink and had similar complaints.

As for our main course,  I went with the sizzling loco moco.  The beef patties were large and very flavorful.  The plate was indeed sizzling and it spat magma-hot gravy on every one at the table.  Overall the moco was good, not great.

The wife had a breaded steak sandwich, which she really seemed to enjoy.  The kids had the katsu sammy and they were both happy.

We finished our meal by sharing a pineapple upside down cake.  To say that the cake was not ""sharing size"" is an understatement.  The ice cream on top was very tasty,  but the cake itself was a bit bland.  I would pass on the cake in the future.

The meal ended with a beautiful sunset over the Pacific strip no complaints there.

33508,4,"Went for dinner on the first night they reopened after doing renovations.

It is really dark if you're not sitting in the covered area. We had to use our phone flashlights to see the menu as did many other diners. Some kept their flashlights on while they ate.

We had a reservation through Yelp, as that's how they take reservations, but later in the night that option was no longer available. We checked in with them about 10 min early because parking was crazy, we had to park about 150m away. Had I not gone up to the hostess 5 minutes after our reservation time, I would have been forgotten. She did apologize and claimed the system was new as well, then sat us. They were telling people without reservations that the wait was 45 minutes to an hour, and 1.5 hours for groups bigger than 4.

We sat at our table for close to 15 minutes before a server realized we had been waiting. He came and apologized and stated that drinks at the bar were backed up so he would come back right after he served the table beside us. When he finally took our order, we were told one of the plates - Alihi plate - was out since they didn't have the fish. So we ordered a couple drinks, adobo wings to start, and the teriyaki ribeye and kalbi ribs. Drinks took another 15 minutes to come, followed shortly by the wings
The wings were great, though only 5 come with the order. Our server told us on three occasions our food was almost ready, but it wasn't till about 50 minutes after placing the order did they arrive. We had seen other guests served before us who were sat after.

The food was very good, we will chalk our experience up to the hectic reopening after renovations. Servers were working hard and really rushing around, and they did apologize for the waits. I have a feeling that the lighting for the uncovered area was not installed because it was very dark, as you can see in the pictures. At least candles should have been placed in the interim. Other guests as I mentioned were using phone flashlights to order and eat. It was busy, but there ended up being so many empty tables because I believe people were not willing to wait to be sat, so I'm guessing nearby restaurants benefited. But still giving 4 stars because the food was good and this was just the reopening craziness.",Aloha Mixed Plate,"['Hawaiian restaurant', 'Restaurant']","Open-air patio is a relaxed, beachside setting for traditional Hawaiian platters in jumbo portions.",1.0843934017028094e+20_1512803375284

I had asked Randy, for local, hole in the wall kind of places so I was expecting Aloha Mixed Plate to be in a strip mall, when we got there and saw how gorgeous it was, my mind was completely blown! We got the best seat, right by the beach, omg, the pics do not do it justice. It was absolutely breathtaking.

Our server was super helpful and friendly. My husband got the Maui Mule and he said it was very good. For dinner he got the Bento box dinner special. It came with the Mochiko chicken and fish. Both were fried to crispy perfection and both were really tasty. He really enjoyed it. I got the Aloha Mixed Plate which came with super tender Teri beef, island fresh fish and my favorite Shoyu Chicken. I rarely get to eat chicken with skin on but the skin on the chicken thigh was the tastiest ever. We both enjoyed each and every bite of our food.

Stunning location, absolutely delicious food and my beautiful family with me, what more could I ask for. I left feeling so very grateful. I couldn't recommend this lovely place enough. I cannot wait to go back again soon with my family.",Aloha Mixed Plate,"['Hawaiian restaurant', 'Restaurant']","Open-air patio is a relaxed, beachside setting for traditional Hawaiian platters in jumbo portions.",1.149693266699984e+20_1583300956460

33640,4,"Aloha mixed plate is very good, but it could be better. First, you should expect a wait. There's nothing wrong with a wait especially when the food and service is good. But that's where our visit went a bit sideways. Our server was fairly attentive in responding to our questions and getting our order to us, but all the servers seemed spread thin and getting ours back to our table took too long.  The food we ordered was very good and well prepared with the exception of the luau pork which was way too salty. (brined too long before going into the umu?). While we were in no hurry (happy to be on island time)  the server took way too long to clear plates, come over to ask if we would like dessert, and then even longer to bring the dessert and finally the check.

I ordered the namesake - The Aloha Mixed Plate:
-Teriyaki Chicken
-Slice of Beef (BBQ)
-Grilled Fish
-Two scoops of rice
-Pasta salad

The chicken and fish were pretty good; the beef was so-so.  I don't understand the popularity of their macaroni salad - it's under seasoned and over mayo'd.

Ordered the loco moco - since when did loco moco come out on a sizzling platter?? I thought I ordered loco moco - not freakin' fajitas! Seriously.... stop. Go to any Aunty's house and ask for your loco moco on a sizzling platter and let's see what happens..... you all know you're going to get a slippah' up the okole. Since when did loco moco cost 16.00?? Are you serious? Oh, and since when did loco moco come out with eggs over hard? Used to come here and aunty would come over and greet you. Now some lady with a southern accent is telling people to wait because she doesn't want to push two tables together for a big group - how's that for some aloha spirit?  Wife orders a plate that is supposed to have shoyu chicken and short ribs on it. Even this haole knows what the difference between teriyaki chicken and shoyu chicken is - they sent out okay at best teriyaki chicken - not shoyu chicken. Oh, and short ribs?? Yeah... it was A short rib as in singular.... a SINGULAR short rib... cut in half. I understand higher prices - it is Hawaii and some stuff just costs more, but for loco moco to go from 9.00 - 16.00 in less than 6 months time ann a single cut in half rib for short ribs and somehow trying to fake teriyaki chicken for shoyu chicken?

The burger I ordered could have been very delicious as the cheese and pickles were great and the bun, wow, but my burger was way over cooked.  Healthy beef has to be cooked to perfection to give it a good taste.  My wife order the fish sandwich.  The ahi was perfectly seared.  It was probably the best unfried fish sandwich I have tasted.

34065,3,"First off, the food was fantastic, from the local kale salad to the seared Ahi, Mahi Mahi, and Ono, to the Chocolate Purse. However, this restaurant only deserves three stars because of some of the worst service I've ever experienced in fine dining.

My family made a reservation for 7:15 and when we arrived, our table wasn't ready. We waited approximately five more minutes before being seated. The hostess also gave us two menus for their ""large party"" dinners, meaning the server had to go back for different ones, which ended up in us all sharing the one proper menu we'd been seated with because he took so long (theme developing). At the time of our order, we ordered wine, only to discover thirty minutes later they didn't have it, after we'd already finished our appetizers. Our server was nowhere to be found at the delivery of our entrees and came by to check on them when they were nearly gone. He never came back to top off the wine we ended up with, either.

All in all, Merriman's was still a positive experience, but they need quite a bit of work on their service, right from the moment you walk in.",Merriman's Kauai,"['Seafood restaurant', 'Cocktail bar', 'Hamburger restaurant', 'Takeout Restaurant', 'Steak house', 'Wine bar']","Sophisticated, multi-level restaurant preparing locally sourced, regional Hawaiian dinners.",1.1316970148518339e+20_1459238174550

The atmosphere is great, it's fun meeting new people, but it is very close to the highway and its associate noise. The initial plates were great, full of flavours and beautifully presented. But then came the salad which I think needed something other than just lettuce.. for the main, the meatball lacked seasoning and was bland. As for the dessert, the chocolate was gritty, which means powdered chocolate was used unfortunately.

34645,5,"Amazing vistas and untouched land surround this one-of-a-kind ocean blowhole that is carved into the rocks. What you need to know: the drive may look like it is not that far from close-by hotels, but it is a windy up and down road with hairpin turns and only a few turnouts. Be respectful of the locals that live there, they will leave you alone if you leave them alone.

There is a parking area at the top with plenty of spaces, and an easy walk out to a bluff where you can see the spray from above. If you are going to hike down, you need to know a couple of things. One: no ambulance is going to get to you anytime soon, so don't be stupid. STAY AWAY FROM THE EDGE OF THE ROCKS AND THE HOLE ITSELF. Right after we walked away a sneaker wave annihilated the entire area and someone was almost swept away. Two, it looks closer than it is. Plan for some time getting down and back up. Three: bring water!

The best advice is bring sturdy shoes and make your own path up and back- traversing is the safest and will not tire you out. If you aren't going to hike, bring binoculars! Lastly, plan on arriving around 2 or 3pm for two reasons; one, there will be wind that will both create waves AND keep you cool, and the morning rush will be over. Stop by a beach on the way back home.

Ok, so the blowhole is cool.  It's the kind of thing you don't get to see very often.  Here's what they don't tell you.

If you are not spry, you will be looking down on this thing from afar.  The ""path"" to get right up to it is steep and rough, often requiring a bit of rock scrambling.  Also, the drive to get there can be pretty stressful for people who don't like heights, driving near cliffs, or hairpin windy roads.

If you can brave the road, then, even from afar, the blowhole is a wonderful  sight.

35009,4,"GOOD:  Free.  Surreal landscapes in this area are beautiful and amazing.

CAUTIONS:  As others have mentioned, it is a rocky shore and it can be dangerous.  However, it's not as if anything will really sneak up on you.  The entire landscape is wide open and you can get as close or as far away as you'd like.  It can be hard to find as there is very little signage.  I found the place by knowing exactly where it was on the map and by seeing a large pull-off area (like a ""dirt parking lot"") by the side of the road.  There were a few of these pull-off areas in the same vicinity and I actually pulled off at a couple before I found the right one.

SUMMARY:  Waters crash into a rocky and ""cliffy"" shore and some of the water sprays up through a hole in a rocky ledge.  Sometimes there is some action every ten seconds and sometimes only every ten minutes... just depends on the water.  While the blowhole was pretty cool, I was more entertained by walking around the shoreline.  There are so many varying landscapes packed into this tight little area.  It's a freebie and the views are spectacular... I highly recommend.",Nakalele Blowhole,['Tourist attraction'],"Powerful ocean blowhole shooting up between lava formations, including a heart-shaped rock.",1.0136681918503982e+20_1369243038716

I ended up getting a coconut mocha with coconut milk, hence the name. It was a good blend of sweet and chocolate-yness, needing a hint more of the  coffee flavor.  My wife ordered up a coconut milked latte.  That was the business. Smooth, creamy coconut milk at first sip and the right amount of coffee flavor at the back end. I preferred my wife's drink over mine, but she wouldn't give it up.

35622,5,"I always knew about this place, and someone has always brought their cakes to family gatherings but I never had to opportunity to actually eat here until now.

I got their chicken plate and noodles.  I wasn't expecting much from their chicken, but WOW.  It's right up there with Korean Fried Chicken from Zippys.  Good sauce, nice sized pieces.  Their fried saimin is good, depending on how you like it.  I like mine more savory than sweet.  The Alley's noodles are a little more on the sweet side, I think, but they are still pretty good.  The portion I though was just a little smaller than expected for the price.

I was also able to taste their onion rings, fries, and burger here.  All were very delicious, the burger tasted homemade.

Before leaving, I purchased a Lemon Crunch and Strawberry Crunch cake slice.  When I got home I had a Pumpkin Crunch instead of the Strawberry Crunch and I was super bummed, but then I tasted the Pumpkin Crunch and was pleasantly surprised.  My mom makes Pumpkin Crunch ever holiday season and I love her version, this was a step down from mom's and most definitely better than the one from Starbucks or anywhere else that I have had it.

I eventually made it back there another time to have their Strawberry Crunch, and you know what?  It was pretty disappointed.  It was very much like strawberry shortcake, but not enough strawberry glaze or filling for me.  Plus, I didn't think that it paired well with the delicious caramelized crunchy bits on top.

The Lemon Crunch is probably the best cake ever, anywhere.  Lol.",The Alley Restaurant at Aiea Bowl,"['Restaurant', 'Bakery', 'Bowling alley']",Creative Asian-inspired takes on classic comfort eats served in a low-key bowling alley setup.,1.171807380630962e+20_1507702301823

35630,3,"I was not impressed with The Alley overall. I went here with some work friends because it was on Diner, Drive-Ins, and Dives, and I figured he would know a good place to eat. We went on a Tuesday night and it was packed (a good sign). But to get into the place took 10 min driving and walking around to find the place. It is on the 3rd story of a shopping mall. Beware Google will tell you, you are right on top of (or actually below) it while you are driving around the parking area.

Once we got in, we were seated quickly and we had a drink orders taken. My table got an appetizer of garlic fries. They were meh. Their fries are the very small straw fries, and they had a ton of garlic on them, and tasted okay. They did not have any kind of cheese or any other spices other than salt and garlic (most of the places I have ordered garlic fries from come with the cheese and such), which was a little disappointing.

We ordered and the food which came out relatively fast. I got the Shoyu Pork. It was a slow cooked pork shoulder in some sauce with two scoops of rice and salad. Again, it was meh, like the fries. I am sure part of it was that I grew up in Texas and have eaten every type of slow cooked meat, but one of the staples of slow cooking is that the meat will easily be pulled apart, especially pork. This pork had to be forced apart. They sauce it was in was pretty good, and made the rice taste good when it was thrown in. The salad was kind of pitiful. it was a few pieces of lettuce with some drops of some dressing that had almost no flavor, and that was it.

Overall, I would be willing to go back to try the bowling and get beers again, but the food was overpriced for what it was. The food is the best I have had at a bowling alley, but it still tastes like it was made at a bowling alley. The service was great from beginning to end, the food was just overall not a winner for me.",The Alley Restaurant at Aiea Bowl,"['Restaurant', 'Bakery', 'Bowling alley']",Creative Asian-inspired takes on classic comfort eats served in a low-key bowling alley setup.,1.0080108864467681e+20_1442445910152

35678,5,Very tasty and very affordable. I was on vacation in Hawaii and had an craving for sushi.  The downside is that sushi can be very expensive at many places and that's not good when you are hungry after a long day enjoying Hawaii's various hikes.   This was an all you can eat sushi option with plenty of tasty choices.  Just keep in mind that you need to make a reservation before going.

The parking isn't great and the bathrooms are single stall bathrooms. The inside is a bit cramped but they use the lanai in the front of the building and the hallway next to it for overflow. We sat inside and I'm grateful for that the hallway seemed stuffy and the outside lanai lacked lighting.

The grade gets slightly more but still easy. The only hazard for the last half is when you look up the see the view, it is easy to slip on the loose rocks, so use some caution and you will be fine. The Water by the monument is a world-class snorkeling spot I loved it there. Make sure you bring a little bit of food to fuel your trip back and also bring lots water, remain well hydrated. My best advice is to arrive at the trailhead at 6:30 in the morning to 7 in the morning, it is nice and cool and the trip down will be very pleasant, have a nice swim look around then hike back up before it gets too hot and busy.

If you want to experience it, do a tour boat that takes you out there by boat and allows you to snorkel. It will save you a lot of time and energy.

36158,1,"After years of my wife harassing me to go to the pig and the lady I finally got the courage to take her there. She claimed that they have good pho based off of what she's been told and I haven't had good pho in a very long time. I ordered the LFC Wings, Makaweli Beef Pho, Duck Fat Rice, Pho French Dip Banh Mi with noodles and a lilikoi cider. Food took forever to come out.

First thing was the wings. Literally whole chicken wings. Didn't really mind was just excited to taste them. First bite was confusing. Is that lemon? Or vinegar? Couldn't tell if I liked them or not. So I proceeded to eat my wings. I was not a fan of them. All I could taste was the vinegar. And super greasy.

After my not so pleasant appetizer I was glad the pho and my wife's Banh Mi were out. I love a good broth. It's what makes or breaks pho. And the broth was too sweet. Couldn't really pick any of the spices. Noodles were over cooked and mushy. I guess the beef was alright. I mean it was tender. Decided to try the sandwich and it was good. No big complaints but there was nothing real refreshing about it. No fresh veggies like a Banh Mi usually has. Wife definitely was not a fan. Just felt heavy for her. Oh and the waiter forgot to bring her the noodles she ordered. Which to big surprise were also mushy.

And I would love to have tried the duck fat Rice but that was another thing the waiter forgot. Small lunch menu and not a complicated order. Somehow he still managed to mess it up. And he only came by twice.

Reservations are definitely a must, we went on Saturday with reservations and got seated right away but heard them telling other guests the only open seating was the bar so it fills up fast! The Ahi Tataki was probably the best thing we had! Spices on the toast and the roasted garlic made nice layers of flavor. Tried a Shrub for the first time, which is vinegar soda, odd but actually quite delicious! Giving it a 4 just because the service was a little frazzled, we had to wait a while for someone to take our order and bring our check.

36221,5,"It took me longer than I would've liked to finally visit this joint and I am almost ashamed I didn't make a better effort to come here sooner.  Having tried a lot of food at a lot of places all over the world and country, I have to say that The Pig and The Lady somehow doled out some of the most unique flavors I've ever tried.  I think this is due to the Vietnamese fusion approach that they took here since most Vietnamese inspired cuisine I've had were fairly straightforward attempts at recreating authenticity.  Here, they took flavors that are very clearly reminiscent of a Vietnamese meal (think bahn mi or pho) along with no doubt traditional methods of preparing them but injected modern twists on them.  Coupled with a trendy atmosphere and good presentation, this place deserves high marks.  Everything I tried was excellent but the Laotian Fried Chicken and The Works (stewed bone marrow) were to die for.

Edit: Their Works and French Dip were no longer available at my last visit but that Laotian Fried Chicken is still to die for",The Pig and The Lady,"['Vietnamese restaurant', 'Restaurant']","Featuring globally accented, modern Vietnamese cooking in a lively setting with communal tables.",1.1031178829883253e+20_1470086374555

Only drawback is that parking is rather tricky, as not much in the way of parking lots. It's mostly parallel parking on the beach service road, which shaves the road down to one lane. Was like a fun puzzle when cars are trying to squeeze past each other on the badly-maintained dirt road.

36562,4,"The Lapakahi State Historical Park is a state park that preserves important archaeological remnants that tell the story of early Hawaiian people who lived along the Kohala coast from around A.D. 1300 to 1920. It was established in 1973 and consists of 279 acres on the leeward side of North Kohala, which can be reached by car  by driving north about 11 miles from Kawaihae on Hwy 270. There is a small building with exhibits and basic explanations of the site. The main exhibits can be reached by walking along two trail loops about 0.5 mi in length, taking you to a canoe halau (shed), salt-making pans, the main walled habitation complex along the shoreline of Koai'e Cove.
In addition, there is a conversation buffer area for the 146-acre Lapakahi Marine LIfe Conservation District, established in 1979, because of the well-developed coral reef that supports an abundance of diverse marine life.

36954,1,"Well, for starters, we are season ticket holders for UH Football. Our seats are actually broken and we've complained several times to both the stadium and UH. Neither will accept responsibility for having to fix the seats. Each will say the other is responsible. I agree, neither is responsible enough to ensure people have an enjoyable time. Second, tonight we were approached at the end of the game by 3 security guards because my 9y.o. son was picking up plastic bottles to recylce. At his age he thought they were police officers and became frightened. When I asked what rules we were breaking, none of the 3 security could answer. In fact, they just gave different answers every time. Not even consistent answers. More like deflections. If someone reading this can tell me, 1. Who do I have to talk to about repair my seats? 2. What are the rules for picking up left over bottles or cans if any?
I am not optimistic that I will receive any answers for either of my complaints. So basically, I just wasted 10 minutes of my life.

The check in was easy and the guy at the desk was one of the nicest people we met in Hawaii.

Their rooms are oddly shaped due to the footprint of the building, but seemingly spacious with a nook for a desk and a really big closet with cubbies and a safe for valuables. Bathroom is small but efficient and most importantly, clean. The AC gets really cold too!

The sweet potato gnocchi and ragout was amazing a great balance of sweet and savory acidic. The steak and tempura lobster tail was sublime. Make sure to get the black barrel if you get a steak because it's like Angel's wings.
Finished off our dinner with a mango cheesecake which was light and fluffy. It had a sour cream tang to match the mango and while I'm usually strictly a thick dense  New York kinda gal, I have 0 complaints about this one.
I am a cat person and it was fun to have a bottle brush tabby roaming the area and the servers were pretty jovial about having it there. I can imagine being less than thrilled if you aren't a cat person.

Since there was no one at the entrance we found a couple seats and sat ourselves, expecting someone to come over, greet us, and take our order (as any normal person would expect). After sitting for quite some time no one came to talk to us, and this was after several servers saw us, as well as hostessed, and bussers. The two us began wonder if it was just us, after 45 still no one. Eventually my husband went to the bar to get us drinks. We were extremely disappointed that if even if it was self serve seating, no one told us. So honestly, we still don't know if it was a self serve area or not. Not a single employee came over to talk to us; not to ask about if we wanted more drinks, or to order food, when there were two different servers working either side of us.

Salad came out pretty fast, it looked like it was left out in the heat a bit long, was not chilled, so not very good.  That's when the long wait began, we know not why.

Service was OK  but food was great.
I would recommend just ordering for pick up.

In response to the Owners reply to my  previous review. I just wanted to clarify that I've lived on Big Island all my life and have been to many restaurants from Kona to Hilo. Since Covid-19, Hawaiian Style is the only restaurant that I have been too that asks customers to wear masks until food arrives.  I understand that each business must take measures to stay open amid this time and I am glad to see small businesses stay open, but until the restrictions become reasonable I will not be dining in as it defeats the purpose of an enjoyable time.",Hawaiian Style Cafe Hilo,"['Hawaiian restaurant', 'Cafe', 'Restaurant']",Classic Hawaiian comfort dishes are served at this casual establishment with a cheerful atmosphere.,1.0916562481270941e+20_1613275490296

I got the lamb ribs with a side of the Mac salad and greens. The mac salad does have tuna so be mentally prepared. I had no idea so I kept wondering why it tasted fishy until I asked! Skip this if you're a fan of the regular mac salad like me! The kalbi was the best I've had actually!!! I was mad at myself that I ordered the ribs instead of the kalbi!

The loco moco is no joke, huge plate of pork fried rice with juicy hamburger patties and chicken patty (think large chicken nugget) smothered in delicious gravy. I loved the loco moco but if only the chicken patty was a piece of chicken breaded and fried rather then a large chicken nugget.

My wife ordered the pancakes, oh boy, the flavor and fluffiness of those bad boys. If only I had more room after my loco moco.

38523,3,"Plentiful food. If you leave here hungry you have a serious problem.
Everything we tried was good.
I had a veggie omelet with hash browns. This choice came with 2 huge pancakes.
Others in my party had the Hawaiian loco moco (good gravy according to my husband),hamburger steak, bacon cheeseburger, and the breakfast bento.
My dissatisfaction has to do with the service. Order was promptly taken but after you are served you are on your own for an extended amount of time. My uncle literally stood up and went to the waitstaff's area to get coffee and water refills. And it was really hot inside. They had a small split AC unit in the back of the restaurant with 2 ceiling fans. We noticed that the fans were turned off shortly after we were seated. When we asked if they could turn the fans back on the response was ""I'll ask if we can"". What? I don't understand. It's stinking ceiling fans. Is your electric bill so high that you'd rather have your customers suffer in the stifling heat?
Left a really bad impression.

Hawaiian Style has great food and lots of it. They're known for their HUGE pancakes that come on the side of their breakfast plates. These pancakes are meals to themselves though they are a bit generic, as far as panckaes go (I'm a waffle guy anyway).

Portions are great, prices are decent but not necessarily better than Ken's, but the wait can be terrible (a function of it being a local favorite).

Definitely, check this place out if you're visiting Hilo.

39416,4,If you're in Poipu area and you want to go see spouting horn Park is definitely something to go take a look at cuz it's only about a 7-minute minute drive from Poipu Beach. It's pretty amazing how you see the water blast up in the air from the pressure. Every time I go there I'm able to see turtles. You'll probably spend about 30 minutes to an hour hanging out just because you're going to want to take pictures and you'll have to wait in line because there's a lot of people trying to do that. But at the same time there is vendors and restrooms right next to it so you'll want to stop at those vendors.

39547,5,"I've been on this trail twice, and loved it. Going, it's straight up, and coming back, it's straight down. The trail is essential a series of steps (not sure how many), and sometimes it turns into actual train tracks. A lot of the steps are high, so you have to lift your legs higher than normal (conversely, on the way back, you have to step down a lot). The most difficult section is the train tracks, which is built in an open area. Not sure what the height is, but it wouldn't be good if you fell off. I've never seen this happen to anyone (those who are careful actually get on their hands and knees to go across). There is a route around it over land for those who don't want to go over the tracks.The views at the top are killer! Not to be missed. It's definitely worth it, going up, and savoring the views.

After being told it was a nice and easy hike, my wife and I set out with only a single, rather small bottle of water. The trail begins misleadingly easy but quickly ramps up as you get to the part where the tracks separate from the mountain and you're now suspended on a train track bridge a good 15 feet from the ground...sure, not enough to kill you but fall the right way and you'll spend the rest of your vacation in either a hospital or in a cast. Also, make sure to dress light, have some dependable shoes and wear a hat. Walking up this trail, the sun is literally beating down on you. The weather that day was like 87 but felt like 97 on that climb. Needless to say our bottle of water was gone by the time we got to the top.

Don't give up. When you reach the top, the view will wow you.

To take this hike, dress comfortably.  Wear good walking shoes. Sunblock, shades, the works.  Locals may take this trail in flip flops, but don't do it.  You need those stable shoes for the hike down as much as the hike up.

39643,3,"Giving a 3 for quality based on price.

For the location, this place definitely fits the price point, but absolutely not the quality or freshness of sushi. We ordered a bunch of nigiri, and two basic rolls, I could honestly compare the quality of the fish to high end buffet fish. Nothing out of the ordinary. We have been to plenty of sushi joints on the mainland, and I believe the sushi here would rate as a 2 in quality back home

The other disappointing thing was the smell, at first we thought it was ammonium but later figure out it smelled like dirty wet cleaning rags in the whole place.

I will say that the service was good, waiter was very prompt, quick and VERY attentive.

The roll selection won't overwhelm but the three we had were quite good, as was the miso eggplant which was presented differently than I've had anywhere else. Sitting at the sushi bar might be the way to go as you can order directly with one of the sushi chef and truly customize your order.

We started with the Fried Spam Musubi. I thought it was good, but it was a lot of rice and I wanted a little more spam.

For entrees, we got the Saimin and the Polynesian Paralysis Moco. We all enjoyed the Polynesian Paralysis Moco. The kalua pork was good and the tempura fish added a nice crunch. I wasn't a big fan of the Saimin as the broth was kind of bland.

We also decided to try poi for the first time and got a side of it. I love taro so I thought it would be good, but I was wrong. It was like a sour yogurt apple sauce and none of us liked the flavor (this has nothing to do with the restaurant though, just wasn't a dish for us).

The portions are huge. We could have shared one entree. The loco moco was probably big enough for three people. This is coming from a group that only eats one meal a day too. Expect a ton of food.

It was noon so expected to wait a little before being seated. We got a corner booth by the door and it was miserably hot. Already put us in an irritable mood as there was no air conditioning and the ceilings were quite high and no fans either, unless we didn't see them.
Our server was nice but did forget our drink, which he did bring it in the middle of our meal and he added an additional side order we did not request. Took awhile to flag another waitress to get more napkins as well.

39832,5,"Da Kitchen is Da Bomb! DDD restaurant that is worth it for Hawaiian-kine fusion.

It has plate lunch staples with a fusion twist.

Like spam musubi? Try it fried!

Like crab cheese wontons? Try their kahlua pork wontons with cream cheese spread.

We got a sampler plate with most of the classic plate lunch staples: chicken katsu, teriyaki beef, and even fried ahi.

I wasn't as impressed with the potato - macaroni combination salad. I'd much rather do basic macaroni salad with my plate lunch, but it was interesting.

Service was outstanding, even as busy as they were.

Be prepared for a line, it's a popular place that could easily expand to a larger footprint.

Definitely worth a try if you want an upgrade from basic plate lunch.",Da Kitchen,"['Hawaiian restaurant', 'Restaurant']",Local go-to for traditional Hawaiian plate lunches serves hearty portions amid a low-key atmosphere.,1.0912126276344624e+20_1577284190150

Amazing.  The rest of our food was great, but the bread they fly in from Molokai daily stole the show. Literally no words. Can get it with strawberries or blueberries.

Fried Spam Musubi was very delicious. I would say it taste better fried. Very flavorful. Probably their best food to order here.

Moco Loco will make you full. The gravy was kind of lacking in flavor. The burger itself was good. We chose greens over macaroni salad. The greens goes very well with the meal. It balance all the carb you are consuming. The dressing is amazing.

Kalbi Fried Noodle was good. The meat was cooked perfectly. The noodle went well with the kalbi meat combination. I like how they had the meat slicer and mixed with the noodle, but they also give you a piece attached to the bone

Their lemonade is delicious and comes in a mason jar. Goes well with most of the meal and is fresh.

Service:
Very excellent service. Waitress was around often and made sure we were okay. The host was also very sweet.

Ambience:
Lively music playing in the background. Surf theme throughout the walls. Seats and tables were made of wood. Kind of makes you feel cozy and somewhere near the sea feel. Plenty of seats, but the place is always busy.

As for your restaurant there was a older guy at the front of the entrance that saw us waiting for help and did nothing. Shame . Made special for someone he knew to get a booth.

Unfortunately, after placing our orders, the waitperson never checked in on us while we sat and watched everyone else in the restaurant get served food who arrived after us.

39988,1,"I have had many great experiences at Da Kitchen.  The food and service has been wonderful. My most recent visit on Sept 23 was less than great.  I ordered a tofu teri veggie bowl and when I found out you were out of tofu I opted instead to ask for a veggie and rice teri bowl.

I was told I could not do this and would have to order the rice and veggies separately.

No problem.

I asked that they be tossed together in a bowl with teri sauce.  I was again told the chef would not do this.  So i asked for the sides and an empty bowl so i could mix myself.

My rice came out.  15 minutes later, after asking twice, my veggies followed and a side of teri sauce with it but no bowl.  I have to ask twice for a bowl before finally being able to mix my now cold food together in it.

Honestly, this type of service does not reflect what is typical at this place.  That being said,  I will think twice before returning or recommending this to anyone.

The service industry is called that because it revolves around serving the customers what they want or need within reason.  Nothing I asked for was unreasonable or impossible.  I don't expect a server at my table to tell me a chef can't mix rice veggies and teri sauce in a bowl.

It's pretty rediculous.",Da Kitchen,"['Hawaiian restaurant', 'Restaurant']",Local go-to for traditional Hawaiian plate lunches serves hearty portions amid a low-key atmosphere.,1.0880201242030644e+20_1570582751810

Order loco moco , Hawaiian platter fried seafood platter ,shau mai , fried musbi and more. Couldn't really say what was good. Dont think I will go back anymore.
