50007,4,Now I love Pizza Hut's pizza. Everything is wonderful there I love their lunch buffet I love their food the only thing that I would say is they need to put more toppings on their Pizza especially when you order for them to come to your home they never put enough toppings on it they skip you out for the price but I think after a while they started to pick up and get better because I tell you what it was only like 3 days ago 4 days ago I ordered a pizza from there and when it came to my door and when I had chicken wings to which were great with the bone in butt when they came to my door it was the best pizza I think I've ever had since I've lived here 34 years or more they put so much topping on that I thought I was in heaven and I must have done something right or something but I tell you they need to keep that up if they want their customers they need to start feeling those pizzas with more toppings and the cheese because that's the way a pizza should be you want that cheese just oozing off and all those toppings falling off. Now that's what I call a true pizza and it's worth it if they could just keep that up I think they would be making more money than ever. So I say all you Pizza Lovers you need to go up there try their pizzas try their Buffet try and order some for home and see what happens like I said I don't think we should have to pay for that those extra toppings because what they did that day I was so so happy. Keep it up Pizza Hut you getting better. Hopefully you got some really good Cooks in there now and when they make a pizza they know what they're doing. So now when I order home I don't have to call up there and say wow where is the cheese where is the meat I paid too much money for this kind of a pizza. I say yay somebody finally knows how to make a great wonderful Pizza. I hope that all of you experienced what I have. I'm saying this for all the people Pizza Hut keep up the good work don't send out sorry looking pizzas send out the best pizza you can send out because you want those customers.,Pizza Hut,"['Pizza delivery', 'Chicken wings restaurant', 'Takeout Restaurant', 'Pizza restaurant']",Family-friendly chain known for its made-to-order pizzas.,1.0544203226432827e+20_1559251154489

50020,1,"Nothing came out right! Ordered 3 orders of wings, 3 orders of cheese sticks, 1 order of mozz sticks, and 1 pizza.

One order of wings came out 25 minutes after ordered and were not crispy at all, like they were rushed through the fryer, then 10 minutes later 1 order of cheese sticks.

25 mins later the 2nd order of wings came out and we were asked if everything was ok now? No were still missing 1 order of wings, 2 cheese sticks, I mozz stick and a pizza.

The pizza came out moments later and was greasy and the cheese was barely melted.

The next order of cheese sticks came out and were ice cold with no sauce.

By this time we had had enough, and asked for boxes and the rest to go. The wings came out around the same time and seemed to be ok.

Got to the counter and we were still charged for the things we hadn't revieved. The girl, who was very kind and sweet apologized and took off the things we didn't recieve and gave us a little discount.

All and all we will never go back again!!!

50030,5,I am a regular customer of the delivery service and I am happy with the food and drivers. I worked in this particular store 24 years ago when I met my husband. I stopped in and spoke with a manager about having my son's 10th birthday party there with about 14 people. We brought our own cake and ice cream and we ordered 7 pizzas. It was a Sunday after church and it wasn't crowded and the whole experience was the least stressful birthday party so far! I was so impressed with the waitress and I made sure to be generous with her tip. They held our ice cream in the freezer until we needed it and the pizzas were the best. The prices were so much more reasonable than we expected and much less than other places that offer birthday parties. We didn't book an official pizza party but it was a really great experience and my stress level was so much lower than all 9 previous birthdays! Thank you Pizza Hut! I highly recommend this store for anything you may need because they are very cooperative and they went above and beyond my expectations and they were all so kind. I may have the next 8 parties there!

50178,2,"My husband and I just visited this place for the first time. We was not impressed in the slightest. We both ordered large ribeye. He got rare , and I got well done. His steak was a little more tender than mine of course which is to be expected for a little but but not that much toughness. My steak had NO flavor. I had to have sauce just to be able to eat it. The ranch dressing that they give is the bottle ranch, and not the real good kind either. The salad was disappointing. It was literally salad mix out of the store with a slice of tomato on top. They don't have anything else to go on salads, not even pickles. My waitress was not friendly. At one point, my husband asked her for extra butter for our baked potatoes, which we requested when we ordered but didn't receive. When she brought it, my husband told her thank you and it almost seemed as though she wasn't going to respond or acknowledge him. Then She turned around and saw our faces and barked out you're welcome. We would have brushed it off as her personality, which still isn't okay. Then one of the regular customers came in and she was as nice as could be to them and waited on them hand and foot like they were the only people there. Then the waitress came to put steaks on our table, she grabbed the dressing tray and said are you done with this. I said no mam I need the ranch off of it. So she leaves the tray. When she finally decides to come refill our tea, she just picks up the dressing tray without asking if we were done ,which we wasnt, and just walks off. My drink stayed empty for a long while and our waitress came and refilled her regular customers who were beside us, and walked past our table 4 times with a tea jug in hand, then went to go talk to the other employees, then sat down at a table, and then finally came to refill our drinks. I'm sorry, but if you can't be friendly or at least smile to ALL your customers and treat them all like they're important then you don't need to be a waitress or working with the public. We did nothing to cause her to be that way to Us and they were not busy.

We came with the expectation of ""VERY GREAT STEAKS AND GREAT SERVICE "" but that was not what we got.
This is my personal opinion to Old hickory, but it's very unsanitary to have the same people preparing food, or having their hands anywhere around food, running the register. Also, if a steak is cooked right, you can have a tender and tasty well done steak. The menu says they are not responsible if well done steaks are not tender or tasteless.

50990,3,I have alway loved cock of the walk but this time I was very disappointed.  It has been a long time since I have visited but I had a fish craving and I was so sure to go here. Upon entering and being sitted everything started great. After that.....Our table was sticky and still had dried food on it.Our waitress who was nice but seemed very rushed which meant she mixed our order with the table behind us. The tables were too close so she continuously pushed my chair up when passing between tables with no excuse me or anything. When our order was corrected our fish didnt seem done and the french fries and fried pickles all taste like onion rings. Like they were all just fried together. My son got chicken tenders which had no favor at all. When the waitress brought our refills she was moving so fast she never even noticed she wasted drink in my greens.... so to say the least I will not be visiting them again. I just feel like for the price the food should be much better. I have gotten better fish through the drive thru at Penn's.  I just hope in the future they would do much better.,Cock of the Walk,['Seafood restaurant'],"Big waterfront seafood restaurant specializing in fried fare served up in rustic, kid-friendly digs.",1.1547947663954621e+20_1392570062503

51784,3,"I am always looking for some good and authentic Mexican food and this was my first time trying Del Sol. It seemed to have good ratings. Here's what I can say. The portions are completely out of control. This may be why it is so popular in the most obese state in the US. The chicken Quesadilla was enough for 2-3 people and the special plate could have fed a family. The salsa bowl they bring out to the table with chips was also seemingly wasteful, no way to eat all that. Now for the guacamole, it needed some cilantro, lime and salt.  The margaritas were 2 for 1 but were pretty watered down.

On the walk up, they have items embedded into the side walk that zig zags up the hill to replicate the zig zag pattern you would run if you were retreating under fire.

52595,4,"A destination restaurant as you are not likely to stumble across it.  Located off a country road and I definitely recommend locating it first in daylight hours if you are going to drive there at night.   Hard to see entrance and you may be tailgated, so beware.   I went on a cold January Thursday which was advertised as Tapas night.  No Spanish tapas and only a few extra middle size plates, all American, to make it qualify as Tapas.  The interior is very attractive and modern with high ceilings and there was an open fireplace visible from many of the tables. A small pleasant bar area.   Prices are moderately expensive but not out of line with the quality of food and ambience, so I would describe it as a fair value.  Professional staff are well mannered and mostly know their stuff and the menu.   I skipped the large plate selections and had a scallop appetizer w slaw, a large bowl of French onion soup, as distinct from the smaller version listed on the menu, and a creme brulee for dessert.   They were all very satisfactory.

After my complaint I received a call a couple days later. She was polite, gave a sincere apology, and i was told she reprimanded the store and driver.

52781,3,The food was not as good as I was expecting. With all the great reviews and selections on the menu I was expecting great to exceptional food. The menu selections sounded great. I got the fish of the day almondine and my wife got the BBQ shrimp and grits. The fish almondine was the worst fish almondine I ever got. Not that it was horrible. But it should have been much better and tastier. My wife liked the shrimp and grits but its flavor was not what one would expect for that dish. It was fair to good but with a different flavor than one would expect. The portions were smaller than one would like. The ambience and service was great. I felt for the price we should have gotten more food. A small salad should have been included with the meal. I would give it a second try. But was disappointed with the entrees given the high ratings of the restaurant.,Sycamore House,"['French restaurant', 'Restaurant']","Elegant eatery in 2 connected 19th-century cottages offering upscale, globally inspired dishes.",1.1699752208617308e+20_1538080302941

52930,2,"Starbucks policy, States if ordered through the app, customers are eligible for free refills of coffee or teas regardless of original drink purchase. Today I ordered an iced coffee, and a frappe, for my girlfriend, ( through the app, in-store). I got a refill, no problem with my iced coffee. I informed my girlfriend of Starbucks policy and asked if she wanted me to get her a refill of iced coffee. I was informed, that the location inside the target, in Flowood, Ms. Is a franchise versus a corporate store, and they do not honor Starbuck's refill policy.  I can accept this, but I won't go there again, because I want my refill, I am curious if this a true representation of what a franchise owner wishes to conduct in their store? I want to add: the lady representing the store, tonight, wasn't rude. Her drinks tasted delicious. She politely informed me that they only give refills if the original purchase reflected the refill. I felt disappointed because I was misinformed by someone. Either Starbucks needs to add that franchise stores might not reflect their policies versus cooperate run stores. And highlight on their locator if the store is a franchise. Or the employee gave me the wrong information. And misrepresented the franchise's policy. I only purchased the product because I thought I was getting a good deal due to the policy that wasn't honored.",Starbucks,"['Coffee shop', 'Cafe', 'Coffee store', 'Espresso bar']","Seattle-based coffeehouse chain known for its signature roasts, light bites and WiFi availability.",1.1008453028596294e+20_1576553997328

52956,1,"This is my first bad experience with a Marriott property and I travel a lot. The fact that I called to confirm my late check in and was not told at that time that the room I reserved over a month in advance was not available is where it all started. When I arrived to check in I waited in line about 15 minutes, then was just given a key after telling her my name, not asking for an ID or credit card. It wasn't until I got to my room that I find out it was just a single bed, I reserved a double bed because I had someone traveling with me and we both wanted to be comfortable for a 2 night stay, I called the desk and the lady tells me there is nothing they can do there are no more rooms. So I went down and she called the manager since there was not one at the property, she was not much help and didn't offer anything for our inconvenience. She only offered to call the Fairfield to see of they had any doubles left. After being at the desk until after 11 pm, because there was a few bus loads of school kids and their chaperones whose room arrangements weren't right either, I just gave up. The only thing the Fairfield had left was the same room I was already in there. The next morning I never heard anything from the manager or any other staff for that fact. I even went to the desk to let the know that room 219 refrigerator was leaking everywhere. She only wrote it down but no one came to check it.

He even said he would put in a new order of wings and have my dressing delivered and it came here in record timing considered he tomr me it would be here in 45 mins.. 20ish mins later here they are at my door, steaming hot wings and guess what... no blue cheese.
Moral of this is everyone gets one chance. I gave it and y'all messed up again.
Improvement definitely needs to be made here.

53137,1,"I moved across town recently and have had to start using this location and I'm not pleased by any means.

I've ordered multiple times and my pizza has shown up cold and I told them I wasn't going to accept cold pizza and when they go to take it back, they never show back up.

I've ordered via phone and via the Pizza Hut website and been promised arrival times that are normally 30 minutes to an hour and a half longer than what was promised upon delivery.

I've ordered a few times and called to check the status and have been told that they never received my order and get up on hold just to be hook up on.

One phone call in particular I was on hold for 22 minutes and then heard someone come back on the line just to hang up without bothering to ask if anyone was still there.

On top of that, I've had multiple occasions where I've tried ordering Dr. Pepper and instead of calling to tell me that they do not have it, they've brought Pepsi or Root Beer in place which would be fine if they had called to tell me but apparently it's just okay in their eyes to just assume it's all soda and who cares what the person paying for it wants.

I've even tried to give back cold pizza or wrong items that were delivered and the driver(s) have said in turn,""You have to pay either way or it comes out of my pocket.""

Excellent wines to have these meals. Great pricing for the working family these days. Over all I recommend this restaurant to any and all. The appearance of this restaurant is so beautifully designed and elegantly laid out. Guys if your looking for a romantic evening for a first date, an anniversary,  or just a night out with the wife, or guys proposing to that special someone here would be a great place.

We bought the kids the chicken tenders and my husband and I were surprised to find that they were extremely tender and very juicy.

I've been to this restaurant several times in the few years since they opened this brand new place. And each time I eat there, there are fewer customers in the house. This time it was a trio of ladies and my party. No other diners came in during our 80-minute visit.
Do the owners deliberately hire inept servers to cut down on dining guests? If so, why did they build a whole restaurant instead of a small shop?
At one point my wife had to get her own drink refill from the server station. Where our server disappeared to is a mystery - not like he had a lot of tables to attend.

It has been better.  Usually it has more sauce and ingredients on it.  It was good, but we have tasted better.  Maybe, they have new employees, who
haven't guiet perfected their amount of sauce and ingredients, or maybe management is new. It was just a little below their standard if excellence, that we have always enjoyed.  We will try it again... that's the only fair thing to do.
I would make the suggestion that some one employed at Pizza hut try out , Little Caesars,. They in our opinion, really have it going on and their prices are a bit cheaper, and they have pizzas made up and they are hot and ready to go!

Well at exactly 8 we arrived and were immediately offered a seat in the courtyard.  It was just lovely out there.  Nice temperature at that hour and a cool breeze.  Keep in mind it is the middle of June.

Dogs are welcome out there too!

Our host was so sweet and he introduced us to the server, and I wish I remembered her name.  I think she does some teaching too?  We heard the specials and immediately dropped our menus and went for it.

The hangar steak was perfectly done to requested temperature and crazy delicious!  The lamb chops (rack) came with 6 and with a strawberry glaze.  WOW!  Our sides were 2 each:  both got the beets, which were in a syrup like sauce without adding anything weird to the flavor... maybe it was puree of beet?  Whatever it was we loved it.  One got the cauliflower which came in a ramekin sort of mashed potato style.  I could have eaten a bowl of that.  And lastly one got the grilled mushrooms and onions.  Also good, but nothing beyond the description.

The cheese was not melty but crusted.

All 7pm guest were seated including many people who come after 7pm. Our group was seated at 7:20pm. We were put to seat outside the patio in cold wind and rain close to those trees. We saw two or more table are wide opened inside. The sweet lady at the entrance told us she would do anything to resolve the problem, but not able to let our group sit inside. We were just not dress warm enough to seat out the cold weather. After 5mins in the cold my 76 years old mom start sneezing. We choose to left Chimney WITHOUT eating our  Valentine dinner. We were very disappointed.
But the owner called us. Sincerely apologize to our experience. He even send us a coupon without expectation!  So we decided to go back.

54785,1,"Their Tuesday night buffet doesn't start until 6:00 (a little late for families with young kids). We arrived about 6:30 and in spite of the fact that no one was there, we had to wait almost 5 minutes for someone to come out and seat us. The waitress never greeted us, never smiled, barely looked at us. She acted like we were ruining her day.
Every pizza on the buffet was pepperoni. Either just pepperoni, pepperoni and sausage, or pepperoni and onions and peppers. We were 4 adults and 2 kids and the kids especially were not happy with pepperoni. We asked the waitress if they were going to put out anything without pepperoni and she turned her back, and as she walked away said yes. Still, when we left, EVERYTHING had pepperoni!
We had ordered 3 drinks for the adults, but only 1 of us got a refill. She ignored the empty glasses the other 2 of us had! Still, she never brought the bill and only gave me the receipt AFTER I paid and I saw that she charged us for 4 drinks. Also, kids are supposed to be free and she charged us for 1 of them.
I don't think I've ever stiffed a waitperson a tip, even with bad service, but I couldn't bring myself to give her even a penny after putting up with her attitude and then seeing how much she over charged. I knew arguing with her would only make the heartburn from the pizza worse.

55252,1,"The worst location ever.  A really horrible experience after placing a call in order.  Order placed a little after 8 PM. Arrived, called to let them know we were there to pick up the order. Had to called back to let them know we were outside due to us waiting for amount an hour.  The manager brought our order out. We checked the order and it was wrong. They have left out an order.  My daughter went into the restaurant to explain the order wasn't correct.  After all of this,  asking to speak with the manager which the staff lied and said she was gone. No one offered an apology.  No one.  Wasn't offer a discount due to the inconvenience.  After all of this we get home and the order is still wrong.  No biscuits were given.  The receipt had everything that should have been in the order but wasn't.  One order was for green beans as a side and a loaded potato.  It had French fries. So they gave us what they wanted to and we had to pay in full for an incomplete order due to incompetence employees. Our order was over 80.00 dollars. Never will I ever eat at any location again.

55934,3,"Edit: Review was written while still frustrated and it shows in the spelling and grammar.
My experience there was frustrating. I placed a mobile order as soon as I parked for a customized venti Pike Place coffee. I waited a few seconds and walked in because coffee rarely takes more than a few seconds. I walk in and walk to the mobile order area to look for my coffee. I do not see it anywhere so I stand around waiting for about 10 minutes. I thought they were brewing some Pike. Finally, one of the guys notice me waiting and asked me what I was waiting for and I tell him I have a mobile order for a Pike Place. He starts to get it but one of the girls steps up and pulls my coffee out from behind the short wall on the counter where it has been hidden the whole time I was there I'm guessing. It was in the very corner of the short wall so it couldn't be seen from either side by the customer looking for their order. I'm not sure what the purpose is in hiding there customer's mobile order is exactly. The Starbucks on Main St. puts it where you can see it and get it and go.
By then I'm irritated and they give me a coffee cup with no sleeve so now I start looking for the sleeves. I don't see them on the counter anywhere so I go look where the sugar and creamer is. It's not there either. After irritably walking around the store with my coffee, which is actually lukewarm and didn't need a cup sleeve anyway, I finally notice that they have the dispenser on the counter on their side. At every Starbucks I gone to cup sleeves are openly available without resorting to reaching across the counter or begging for one. So I reach across and tear one out of the dispenser. Now of course I didn't actually need one of course because my coffee is lukewarm but I like to have one as a barrier so I don't get anything sticky on my hands. And I don't appreciate having to put that much effort in a transaction that should have been effortless. I should have walked in and my order should have appeared in a spot that customer can actually see and pick up my coffee and be able to grab a cup sleeve and go.
Also I would figure if a customer walks in and immediately goes to the mobile order area or in that general area and doesn't go to the other end to place an order then he must have the mobile order.

Now when i listed those don't think its like taco bell because its nothing like that at all. It combines the buid your own item style that subway uses with sandwiches except replace sandwich with tradional southwestern style food.  You get to chose between refried, pinto, and black beans. On the meat side of things there is chicken, beef, steak and even carnitas(pork). All the toppings you can think of mutiple types of pico and dressings. Awsome tasteing chips are given with each order to which you can go to the salsa bar that has multiple types of salsa. I personally like the medium tradional and pineapple salsa.

56118,3,"Exact same review as for the library. It is on the same property.

They have done a great many repairs since Hurricane Katrina damaged it so much in 2005. It faces the Gulf of Mexico. I am currently listening to the podcast ""1865"" which discusses the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and the repercussions and how the ending of the Civil War came to an unraveling so much.

Jefferson Davis may have been the 1st and only President of the Confederacy, the emphasis here is on the states rights, specifically to own slaves. This is a narrow view of states rights, but the only one they held. I missed out on the beginning of the tour, but what I did get was informative, if a bit too narrow. The grounds, cemetery and library are immaculate, and this should be enough of a testament.

The staff members are very friendly, this is a good place. I just think that the view of the history should be broader, especially when so many are still disenfranchised even in 2019. I would suggest coming here to see it as a reminder of the past and that it should not be repeated. There are reenactments, though I have not seen it, I would be interested.

My bf took a sip and said there's not even a slightest of sugar in it. I brought it back in to be remade. The guy said ""I personally made it myself, I did put 2 pumps. If I put 2 pumps and you don't taste it then...uhh I don't know."" I ALWAYS ALWAYS HAVE ORDERED TWO PUMPS IN THE LAST 15 YEARS WITH STARBUCKS.

He was being sarcastic and showed me the sweetener and said ""Not trying to be a smart allic, but I want you to watch me put in two pumps."" Yes you are being a smart ass doesn't matter how you put it. Anyway, it came out the way it should taste. I can close my eyes and be able to tell if my frap has 1 pump, 2 pumps, 3 pumps or the regular 4 pumps. I've had it enough to know it like the back of my hands.

We ordered the boneless wings and a large stuffed crust pizza. The pizza was delicious but the wings weren't good at all. (I didn't expect buffalo wild wings type wings) but they tasted very processed. The medium buffalo tasted nothing like buffalo. It tasted like a bland hot sauce with a bunch of vinegar. The guy at the front desk checking people out was very pleasant and nice.

The Chicken Marsala was ridiculously huge, but inedible because it was greasy and tough. The Braised short rib ravioli had way too much sauce, smelled like nothing but horseradish when it was supposed to have ""a touch of horseradish"" and the short ribs inside the ravioli we're flavorless and very very tough.

The staff are some of the friendliest i have ever had the pleasure to serve me. The seafood eggrolls are very cheesy and stuffed with yummy. Shellie Lewis who i believe is the Manager stopped by our table  and the other tables to make sure we were well taken care of.

57313,2,"Everything is covered in butter or grease. Food is bland, grits were ok one time and another time runny. Food came out room temperature, hash browns were not a slight bit crispy, sausage was dry. Cheesecake was not creamy, it was way too dense. Pastas are pricey and hardly had any seafood, all the sauces on the pastas were all the same sauce! We got 3 different pasta dishes thinking it's 3 different pasta and sauces, the girl didn't care to mention that we ordered the same dish, but just with different proteins.

I liked their pancakes and my bf really liked the 1lb burger and onion rings. My sis said her root beer float was good.

The tomatoes were done perfectly and with a very light breading and very tasty.  The chicken salad was excellent except for the chicken and searching for the bacon .  The chicken breast was a small fillet that was warmed up and sprinkled with blackened seasoning. With the burgers and steaks they have there, it could have been easily grilled.  It was not and it was evidenced by no seasoning on one side or grill marks.

57693,1,Let's start with the smell. I can only describe it as stale butt. My family had waited 45 minutes for a table because that's where my mother wanted to eat. We went in and they still weren't seating anyone. They didn't seat anyone because they didn't have servers. They hadn't bothered to tell us that when they said 45 minutes. The people who did have food were complaining about it. No matter. I left.,Red Lobster,"['Seafood restaurant', 'American restaurant', 'Angler fish restaurant', 'Bar', 'Crab house', 'Event venue', 'Family restaurant']",Lively chain restaurant serving American seafood standards amid New England-themed decor.,1.0839745172894679e+20_1580080386117
57694,2,"It's been a while since I last went to Red Lobster. After my recent visit, I'll never go back. This is a chain restaurant that has never been netter than average. However, I i used to like to go because, for the money, it was pretty good. Not anymore.  We took a party of 12 and there was very little traffic at the restaurant that day. It was a Saturday afternoon. They pushed a round 6 top next to a smaller square 4 top and tried to cram us in. We took it upon ourselves to add an empty 4 top to get us seated. After 90 minutes we were still waiting for our food. When it arrived most of it had been sitting for quite a while and was little more than room temperature. A quick survey revealed less than half was a proper temperature. The prices are pretty close to what you see at a much more upscale restaurant. In all, the food was bland, uninspired and expensive for the quality. Our server was nice. He did a fairly decent job. We could have had a better meal for at least a hundred less dollars next door at Olive Garden and I'm no fan of Olive Garden.",Red Lobster,"['Seafood restaurant', 'American restaurant', 'Angler fish restaurant', 'Bar', 'Crab house', 'Event venue', 'Family restaurant']",Lively chain restaurant serving American seafood standards amid New England-themed decor.,1.0229905595932125e+20_1574667923700

57698,2,RL has always been my favorite go to seafood spot. Unfortunately I can now say that I doubt I'll return. I ordered the takeout family meals of the cajun chicken pasta and the CYO feast meal...the pasta sauce had a weird taste to it and the fried fish i ordered was such a tiny order I only received 4 small broken up pieces. My shrimp in our pasta and the scampi were rubbery and hard to chew. When ordering I asked if they would make sure my condiments for my items were in my bag but needless to say when I arrived home they were not and I also only had 2 biscuits! 2!! The order i placed each stated they came with 8! I spent 85.00 on a subpar meal and thats me being nice.

She was so friendly and great help as we asked for suggestions.  Everything, she suggested was wonderful!  You start off with a bowl of soup... I had selected potato and bacon soup and (Haw!  It was fine!). Ebony, had just made believers out of it.  Wes was about to select Crabmeat soup.  In a polite ,way, she explained that either the cook was not in  the same one or it
Watered down...she was right again, Wes loved the soup!  Red Lobster is well know for it's delicious cheese biscuits and they are still Divine!  As my main entry.. I wanted the""Conconut
Shrinp "" with a speacial coconut dip to go with it!  It was was made with a coconut, pineapple  and a white sauce was douglish,.! We had a salad or coleslaw.  I loved the coleslaw and was asked to try some more which they wanted to see which coleslaw.that coustomers liked the most.  I agreed to try, but this one wasn't as good as the first coleslaw that I had.  Then came the desert!  Apple pie all pie with Ice cream...it was a 10 for sure.!

I ended up having to wait about 20 minutes for my ""already paid for"" items after waiting 15 minutes in the checkout line because that's where you pick up your order. The employee couldn't have been nicer and apologized several times for the wait.  Personally I shop online so I don't have to go to the store, I don't have to wait in line and it's automatically shipped to my home.  Old Navy cut themselves out of my list of stores today.
The only reason I'm doing three stars is because the employee was trying so hard. Apparently Old Navy sends an email saying your order is ready but it is not really.  It is only being put together.

58028,3,"The building needs some work. The ceiling is leaking over the buffet bar.  The pizza is good and service is friendly, but the building itself feels dirty and in bad repair.

Update: The leaky spot over the buffet has been repaired.  You wouldn't know there had been a leak now if you hadn't seen it.  The pizza is good and the service is friendly, but there is still room for improvement.  I've seen the same 3 employees running that place each time I've been there in the last few years.  Melissa works hard to wait the entire dining room alone, and often ends up bussing tables as well.  It's clear that it's just too much for one person when the lunch rush fills the building.  I think that is part of why the building feels dirty.  The building is just old and the lack of natural light doesn't help matters any.  Finding people that are willing to work, and that work hard is a challenge, but I hope they can get someone in there to help.  We were told to seat ourselves, but had to wait at a dirty table for it to be bussed and cleaned.

Another update: February 2019
The ceiling over the buffet had been repaired, but the problem still exists.  The last time I was in there for lunch, that fresh paint on the ceiling was bubbled and looked like it must be holding water.  I enjoy the pizza, and Melissa's service is still great, but someone needs to work on this building!  I would imagine that the people actually managing and working this location have little control over the maintenance of the structure itself.  Pizza hut corporation needs to shut this location down, FIX THAT LEAK OVER THE BUFFET, and do some remodeling, like new carpet.  I've not eaten in any other pizza hut location, so maybe they are all the same dark, cavernous feel inside... But it would be great if there were more natural light in this building.  There are a few small windows along the front, but that is not sufficient.  I would describe it as feeling like I'm eating pizza in a bar.  I've attached a picture to show the bubbled ceiling over the buffet - watch what you eat because that paint isn't going to hold that water forever - and you can see that the building is dark.  The only lighting in the ceiling is a fixture over the buffet and the rest are pendants hanging over each table.  I don't think the cavernous feel would bother me quite as much if I didn't feel like the whole building were dirty and the grime is hidden by the lack of light.",Pizza Hut,"['Pizza delivery', 'Chicken wings restaurant', 'Takeout Restaurant', 'Pizza restaurant']",Family-friendly chain known for its made-to-order pizzas.,1.1828776321815385e+20_1549806709209

I ordered the Bryant, which comes with bacon fried onion and dijon mustard, with mac and cheese. My wife had the Asian Burger with onion rings. I ordered my Burger medium my wife medium well. My Burger was beyond well done. I took a bite and beside tasting the grease all I tasted was the mustard. The mac and cheese wasnt even worth writing about. Not worth the one hour wait. My wife did not like her burger because it had no flavor. We would have told the waiter but between the wait and the server somewhat coming by to give me warm water down tea I didn't see the need. My wife ordered the chocolate milkshake and I ordered the salted caramel. My wifes came out after five minutes. Mine came out after we paid the bill.

58335,4,"How can one not love this place?  It's Starkville and MSU tradition, and a delightful greasy spoon, to boot!  Step right in to a warm, homey atmosphere and the best breakfast in town.

Although they get super busy almost every day, it's usually worth the wait.  Having had both breakfast and lunch here, I can say both are quite good.  The blue plate specials are solid, although the food does tend to be a bit greasy.  That's just part of the charm.

Breakfast is the shining star, though.  Fluffy pancakes, crispy hash browns, and eggs however you like them.  Check out the biscuits - a southern classic.  Be like me and get sweet tea for breakfast; it's strong and delicious.  Bacon is always crispy, but if you're a sausage person...you MUST get the sausage.  It's homemade, and some of the best sausage ever.  Keep your eyes peeled for Starkville ""celebrities"" here -- I'll never forget visiting one morning when the whole girls basketball team rolled in!  Teaire McCowan is a beast, and I love all the other girls, too.

I ate my meal, proceed to take a bite of the lemon pie and it is hard as a rock I had to rip at it with my teeth like a jerkey stick.

The filling supposedly lemon was dark as motor oil and literally tasted just like the smell of a building that was just built (paint, wood, concrete, sawdust, chemicals). I've never tasted something so rancid in my life. It was horribly gross. For sake of the establishment I didn't post a photo bc I may have been 1:1,000,000 it happened to. I don't care. I just stopped the waitress me pointed at it she immediately informed her manager. The nicely offered a different dessert but my stomach wouldn't accept anything else nor will it the rest of the day probably. I can't get the taste out of my mouth. I have so very sensitive sense of smell so it was just that much worse. The place was clean(smelled newly built looked it too), employee was nice, and the food was not bad. Just a bad experience. I'm giving 2 stars simply because I feel stuff like that should be caught before a customer does.

Staff seemed to be smiling despite just having had a huge holiday spike in traffic. However, the restaurant is in dire need of some upkeep. When you walk in, it's obvious that everything is the same grease stained color of brown, like most grill restaurants would be after a long time.  It needs a good paint job and some deep cleaning. I fear there might also be roof issues. Most obvious issue looks like the serving counter in front of the kitchen is collapsing (see the picture attached). If so, that should concern the inspectors.

58880,1,We were looking for some food at 9pm and it was one of very few open. We arrived and 3 waitresses were out in front of door smoking cigarettes. No one said hello or welcomed us. We started to open the door and saw a waitress cleaning a table she gave us a look of pure hatred. We ignored it and entered. She told us to sit wherever we wanted. We sat down at a booth. We were waiting for her to come take our drink order and while waiting my sister who was across the booth from me started pointing at the back of my seat. I looked behind me and found a roach on it. I was totally grossed out and we left. I did tell the waitresses out front about the roach.,Denny's,"['Diner', 'American restaurant', 'Breakfast restaurant']","Casual diner chain dishing up classic American comfort fare, including all-day breakfast favorites.",1.0879566307181699e+20_1591674964550

Thing is,  I'm a pretty reasonable person and a wonderful tipper so if the restaurant was packed, I would've gave him the benefit of the doubt but the restaurant was VERY SLOW!  I finally saw Celeste( another server that over known since she was a child) and asked her can she get my server for me. He finally overheard the conversation and walked out apologizing and admitting that he had forgotten me!! I still didn't leave at this point.  I just thought to myself, ""He just missed his blessing, NO TIP."" I then tried to place my order after almost 30 min of being there and both items that I tried to order, THEY DIDN'T HAVE!!!

There is always something fun and exciting to try on the menu if you visit infrequently. They have lots of turnover so usually you never see the same staff twice. But overall I would recommend is based off of the sheer fact that they're open 24 hours 7 days a week and on the days that you're lazy it works for it is.,Denny's,"['Diner', 'American restaurant', 'Breakfast restaurant']","Casual diner chain dishing up classic American comfort fare, including all-day breakfast favorites.",1.1712004543203359e+20_1531507598263

I also noticed that you guys have more burgers on the menu and the last thing we need is another burger joint,  we got plenty of those and I use to love coming to you guys because of the variety that you had dennys had everything from chicken to beef now our choices are very slim.

The entire museum focuses specifically on Mississippi (not the rest of the South) and the Civil Rights leaders from here. It is a museum for Mississippians to know the truth about their heritage and make sure we challenge lies and idolized versions of the past.

The information doesn't pull any punches, rightly so, about the place of African-Americans in Mississippi before the Civil Rights Movement, and their fight for rights during the Civil Rights Movement. The Closed Society exhibit was the most difficult to go through, but it is presented in a way that illustrates the poignancy of that time and shows why this is so important.

59393,5,"I'm from MS.  Took MS history in school 25 years ago.  We weren't taught all of this, or if we were, it didn't stick.  Or I wasn't ready to hear it as an 8th grader.

This museum is world class.  I don't know what I was expecting, but nothing this well done in my home state.  I always expect half done efforts, and I'm usually disappointed.  But this museum is top knotch.

I did get a bit fatigued toward the end because it is just so much information and reading.  The little shows and experiences are a nice break from reading all the happenings.

The museum has made me appreciate things much more.  And I'm definitely going to read up more on our history as a state.

We've come a long way in such a short time.  We've still got to finish up the fine details.

Also, leave your pocket knives in your car.  I saw the sign, then saw the metal detector and had to turn around to go put my knife in my car.  Came back to security guards and a police officer to see me through the detector.  I'm just a normal southern guy.  We carry pocket knives.  I'm not a threat.  It was humourous to me, but I guess people are crazy these days and you can't be too careful.  Maybe posting about a metal detector and no knives in the parking garage would be a good idea.",Mississippi Civil Rights Museum,"['History museum', 'Local history museum', 'Museum', 'Tourist attraction']",History museum with interactive galleries exploring the state's role in the civil rights movement.,1.0936342694534006e+20_1530867619023

And forgot to take mustard off my burger and piled on the onions. Also the fries were cold. I went back to correct these items and no one was at the register. But several employees looked at me and nobody spoke or asked me did I need help. Finally I asked ""who's working the front""? A manager who had passed me up turned around and helped me. He apologized and gave me an upsized fry. However, they weren't fresh. But he did try so because of this particular manager trying to make things right I didn't give them a 1 star. I won't be back to that one. The food costs too much not to get it right. It was Diberville MS. Sorry no pictures.

Simple task of not putting lactose intolerant things on burgers had lead me to believe that this big wage hike and are a joke for fast food.

59887,2,"It makes me sad to give a location such a poor review... But trip after trip, this is one of the worst drive thru's I have ever experienced in speed and efficiency. This drive thru is so lacking. I love wataburger's food, but almost without fail the order is wrong when we go to this location drive thru. Most of the time we just leave with our wrong order, but last night I requested they fix it. It took probably more than 7 or 8 min to order 4 kids meals. It was repeated back several times, the last time finally correct only to get the order and it was wrong. I try really hard to not be a difficult customer and give people the benefit of a doubt, maybe he was new. But someone should have been assisting him, their should have been some guidance... They did make the changes with a smile at the window, but a drive thru with no one if front of us should not push anywhere close to 20 mins. This is not the first time we have had the same issue, but it will probably be the last. I'm not sure we will go back to this drive thru ever. Definitely not when we are trying to hurry so we can get home and put kiddos to bed. I think some of the issue is they are under staffed, lack supervision, direction and apparently lack training.",Whataburger,"['Restaurant', 'Breakfast restaurant', 'Chicken restaurant', 'Fast food restaurant', 'Hamburger restaurant', 'Takeout Restaurant']","Circa-1950 fast-food chain for counter-serve burgers, some stacked with multiple patties.",1.073204849580154e+20_1551113407132
