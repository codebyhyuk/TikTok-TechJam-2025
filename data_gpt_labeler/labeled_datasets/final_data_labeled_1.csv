Coming off memory lane, they have all fresh ingredients and premium meats! I like that they feature vegetarian options for the whole menu! I miss the Huberts lemonade they sold at this location, but they still have fountain drinks and other bottled drinks. A must stop before a waikiki beach day or after a trip to the zoo!

236,2,"I felt it was a little overpriced, but that's somewhat to be expected of resort dining.

My larger issue was that the menu didn't represent what we were served.  My wife's dish was supposed to have mushrooms and spinach. There was hardly any spinach and it had broccolini and green peppers. My dish was supposed to have local vegetables and had broccolini but also had mushrooms, which I don't consider a vegetable, and I picked the dish because it didn't list mushrooms as an ingredient.

I was also surprised that there was no option to add cheese or cracked pepper to the pasta.

That said, once we picked out what we didn't want the food tasted very good. My son's pizza was delicious.

EDIT: We got grab and go breakfast and it lowered my review. The croissant sandwich was supposed to have cheddar cheese but had american instead. Both my son and I were greatly displeased. AGAIN the menu didn't match the food delivered.  This is a MAJOR problem.

In addition, the english muffin on my wife's sandwich wasn't toasted, which is lazy and lame.",Nui Italian,['Italian restaurant'],Open air Italian dining room preparing a selection of Italian food within a resort hotel setting.,1.0839715421920815e+20_1609479907016,1

259,5,"We were so delighted to find an Italian restaurant with focaccia like we had in Rome! The lobster chowder was excellent and was big enough for us to share. It would have been better had they provided two little strips of foccacia to go with it, knowing that we were intending on sharing it before our main meal. My husband had the foresight to order the foccacia separately. We also enjoyed the pepperoni and salami Roman pizza. This pizza was plenty big enough at the smaller portion or half size for us to eat and take some home. The crust is thick but it is so full of wonderful air bubbles that it doesn't seem like you're eating a brick as some focaccias do. I don't particularly like salami but this was really tasty and lean. It's important to know that the restaurant is at the opposite end of the resort from the entrance. The valet parking is free if you're using that restaurant, which is a real plus considering the cost of parking around the Hilton. Take the tram to the restaurant if you have any issues with walking. If not you can walk to the right, down a long hall that has some very interesting objets d'art from Asia. I would give myself time to read several of the plaques just to enjoy the experience of basically going to a museum on the way to dinner. We were seated very quickly once we arrived. The restaurant has two walls open to the air which views a garden, but it does have what looks like some air conditioning and fans on the interior.

Not impressed with the food.. In Australia we have Guzman y Gomez and this other takeaway store called Salsa's ... They're only takeaway stores but better than this place.
I probably could've ordered something better but didn't wanna go through the whole menu, my cousin was thinking of Chimichanga so make it easier I picked that
I couldn't hear the woman at the counter, I don't think she could hear me
There's a long line, I felt pressured to hurry and just order anything
This place caused stress for me in itself as well as between my cousin and I.. I tried to shout her and didn't know she was gonna change her mind.. place was too loud and busy.. so made decisions on the fly.. I didn't like this place at all

The pigeons walking around the dining floor grossed me out.   Those birds are full of diseases. Instead of closing the door, the manager chose to shoo the birds out, then the birds returned immediately . He looked very unprofessional doing so.

This never works with the front very hot and the back very cold. On top of that, they tried to save money on the lighting to pay for all that air conditioning. The place was ridiculously dark.

It started well, the wait was less than advised and we got a great table but that was about it.
The poke ahi was tender but far too much sesame oil was used so it completely overpowered the dish. The salad we ordered from the superfood section was tasty and reasonable portion but the shepherds pie was well below par, it was hard to taste much as the salt was overpowering, no amount of water could dilute the taste of it. We didn't stick around for desert, we tried The Cheesecake Factory but it will be our first and only time, there's so much more on offer in Waikiki.

1465,4,"I really didn't want to go to this place, but as in all ""democratic societies house rules and I was outvoted three to one.""  My idea would've been to go across the street to the ""International Market Place"" and get some inexpensive nourishment like some ""sushi and a bowl of ramen.""  ""Ooh, we did last night, silly me wanting to save some money....

Besides, we had walked the length of the strip and were getting famished.  Of course we didn't make a reservation and like dozens of other people, mostly tourists like ourselves, endured the extended wait.  What I did find amusing was that as we were standing around we all look like a ""flock of flamingos,"" watching and goggling at whoever was attention-grabbing to look at and vise-versa.

I also never detected before, but standing there waiting for our supper, I detected the myriad of different languages spoken from all over the world.  I heard German particularly because I served a tour there and spoke the language.  Waikiki is just a smorgasbord of people from all ethnicities.  Enough about people.

About 45 minutes later, we were called and shuffled into the restaurant and seated at a booth with a view of the interior of shops next to the Cheesecake Factory.  Our waitress arrived promptly and gave us a menu to look at while she retrieved out drink order (that and the bill was the only quick service we got that evening!).

Service was very long in getting around to us, probably due to the enormous volume of tourists like ourselves.  We waited for drinks, refills, and our orders, which took a long time. I ordered the spaghetti just because I love it and wanted to try it for the first time at this place, which as it turned out was a disappointment.  I've unquestionably had better elsewhere and of all the places that we have eaten, one of our favorite restaurants, ""Bucca De Peppo"" out in California, makes exceptional spaghetti anywhere!

The rest of the table ordered salads to sandwiches and when it came time for the bill it arrived really fast!  The cost of what we ordered also reflected the place, which I thought was a bit expensive.  Now, only if service and the meals could've been just as fast I might have been impressed.

Nothing special about their meals other than in the restaurant's name itself.  In my opinion, this restaurant is more catered to the tourist atmosphere, which brought us to this place for the novelty effect.",The Cheesecake Factory,"['Restaurant', 'American restaurant', 'Dessert restaurant']",American chain restaurant offering sizable portions from a vast menu including signature cheesecake,1.0552930005654566e+20_1490996716782,1

1596,5,"We got a table after reserving a table and waiting an hour at before 6:30pm on a Saturday evening when everything was opening back up after the pandemic, which wasn't bad. After we placed our appetizer orders (Fried Calamari and Fried Mac and Cheese balls), our appetizers arrived after 10 minutes. We placed our main course orders and received in another 10 minutes. We had a party of seven, so all of our food came at once, so no one was waiting for their food. I ordered the Shepherd's Pie and for dessert, I got the Caramel Apple Cheesecake.

No one's water was empty for more than a couple of minutes since the wait staff made their rounds pretty diligently, and soft drinks were refilled pretty quickly once they were notified of it.

From my party, no one had any complaints of their food, and some of us were so stuffed that we brought home a couple bags of unfinished food in to-go containers. We had to transfer our own food dishes from the plates to the containers - I don't know if that's how they did it prior to this pandemic, or it was the way because of it.

I don't usually go out to eat at a restaurant like this, and I don't know where it stands on how fancy it is, but what I do know is that I'll be coming back when I'm either in the neighborhood (Waikiki is a far drive from my home) or will come back when we are celebrating another social event.",The Cheesecake Factory,"['Restaurant', 'American restaurant', 'Dessert restaurant']",American chain restaurant offering sizable portions from a vast menu including signature cheesecake,1.1402907804397013e+20_1623628274203,1

We ate lunch at one of the picnic tables and then went down to do the ""hike"".  It's basically a small circle loop that is a fenced in path to the waterfall and back.  Half of the circle loop was closed because it looked like a large palm tree had fallen on it.  The portion of the circle loop we did was shaded and you pass some other pretty waterfalls on the way to the main falls.

The waterfall is beautiful and I am glad we came to saw it.  Although the ""hike"" there and back took maybe 10 to 15 minutes.  It was a pretty quick stop for the long drive out.  I would recommend planning your day with some other waterfall stops to make the drive worth it.

FOOD: The food was really good, not dry and no ""oldness"" when we went. My favorite was the CHICKEN which paired really well with the yakiniku sauce right after it comes off the grill. My wife really liked the PORK BELLY. I also enjoyed the FRIED RICE which is just right, its not oily like before.

REQUEST: Please bring back the Jello!!

SERVICE: Though I miss some of the old workers who were really nice the new workers are very nice, always checking on us to see if everything is alright and if we needed anything to constantly refilling our waters and sodas to changing out our grill several times during the course of the meal. But most importantly there was no attitude when you ask them for something.

For me, it has got to have meat and be spicy.  I zeroed in on the Pepper Chicken and Lamb Tikka Masala. Wow, both were over the top with great spices and preparation.  The yellow rice was a nice compliment for the curries, but if you want brown rice, they got that as well.

They have a few other items other then curry to complete or make your meal and I really enjoyed my homemade Ginger Lemonade that I got to wash down the spice with. Really was perfect to cleanse the palate after such a flavor extravaganza.

3008,1,"I was a bit hesitant to write this review, but here it goes.

RATS!   Rats!  rats!

Running wild!  in the Storage Area of the kitchen where are the plates, silverware, cups and cooking pans are kept.

Personally I was a huge fan of Treetops Restaurant and LOVE the location.

But after ""The New Management"" took over this year, its clear to see they have it all wrong.

RATS!

From the 7 balconies, Especially in the Storage Area behind the kitchen where are the plates, silverware, cups and cooking pans are kept.

They do not have a front door to the restaurant, just a roll up gate.  (They were advised to put a door and screens on to enclose the entire restaurant, but they did not listen).

This means rats, bugs, birds and anything that can fit can stroll on in.

Sounds harsh I know, but I have seen them with My Own Eyes on many occasions.

You can see the traces of them... small brown droppings.

And have taken pictures of them.... Gray Hair small eyes.

Think of it, the restaurant is in the Rain Forest, with no door and missing screen on the windows....

I hate to mention all that.

Some pleasant servers who care about their jobs, but the food and environment is lacking quality control.

I am contacting the Health Inspector so they will hopefully clean up their act.

Too bad, I love the location, but not the infestation of Rats!",Treetops Restaurant,['Restaurant'],Traditional Asian-inspired buffet in a light-filled food hall with a canopy view of the rainforest.,1.0208209626208199e+20_1436568481445,1

I told her no I lost my appetite at that time so I threw away the plate. So she said she would fix my order witch I was fine with. When I went back to the store spoke with her she informed me the reason witch I understand but what came next was really messed up I paid for a 3 choice plate she was going only give me a 2 choice explained to her how is that when I paid for a 3 choice and she was going give me a 2 choice as a replacement then she said this time I'll do the 3 choice. So that means if they mess up they can short us from what we paid never experienced that from any pandas before. While she was redoing my order I had to wait on the side and she made the plate. When given she gave me someone else's plate??!! I'm confused how that happened I was done with the irresponsibility from them I wanted to leave. I'm never going to that location again.

3201,2,"For me, OVERRATED restaurant!!! My husband cooks a way better steak and seafood dinner!!!!

Out of fairness to the negative tone of my review - I think providing a little more detail on my personal experience on this occasion would be fair to the restaurant.

I attended this restaurant with a group of 17 ladies.  We were seated at 2 tables next to each other with 10 ladies on one table and 7 ladies on another.

The waiter came around and took all our orders.  As the food came to the table,  there was a slight confusion on the orders.  Two people at our table got the wrong order. But instead of returning the order - they opted to eat what was in front of them to avoid waiting for their correct order to come out.

Honestly,  the original waiter returned to our table ONCE after everyone got their food.  We requested refills on water and drinks - no one came to refill our table.

The food wasn't anything different than what's served at any steakhouse.  It wasn't an experience that deserved 5 stars for the amount of monies we spent for this gathering.  I definitely voted that our group never return there.

3202,5,"My wife and I had been wanting to eat at this highly recommended steakhouse since moving to Hawaii and finally got the chance last night. Ample parking, elevator access and great views from the second-floor lanai. Hostess was quick to accommodate our request to sit outside - they hadn't planned on opening the lanai last night but she said no problem and we were seated at a table within 5 minutes. Service staff was excellent and helped us choose the right dishes in consideration of my wife's dairy allergy. Menu was not large but there were plenty of protein options to satisfy any appetite. Portions were larger than expected - everything was a-la-carte and we badly miscalculated, each of us ordering a steak and 2 sides, leaving us with plenty of leftovers to bring home. Service included complimentary bread and butter, as well as champagne and dessert on the house (we were celebrating our 12th wedding anniversary). Prices were high but certainly comparable to other premium steak houses we've visited, all with unsurpassed service.

At this time, 3 other customers came in ordered their drinks with the cashier and received them before I got mine. How is that possible??? My drink was just a Green ice tea. The darn tea is already made. After 15 mins, I was literally the 2nd to the last person to leave the store...I was going to say something but knew it would just be a Sorry thing and not be sincere.

OLD REVIEW:  I heard great things, but my first experience was not good by any means (raw hamburger and not ready on time).  I can see it being good, though. I ordered online for a pick up at 11:30 (paid online, too). Came in on time, asked about my order, and was told it'll be a second. I waited ten minutes and asked again. It turned out they didn't start my order until I after arrived.  I got my food almost 20 minutes after it was supposed to be ready. When I got back to the office, I found the burger was RED AND COLD on the inside.  I asked for medium, this was not close to that. It also looked like it was thrown in there with no attempt to construct a burger, maybe I was meant to build it myself.  It all seemed rushed, which is a shame given the quality of the good looked good.

I did not feel like going back to fix it or get a refund.

The fries were fine, but definitely over salted.

Maybe I went on an off day, but it was bad.

I'll go again because their other restaurant is great and the menu here looks promising.  I'll revise my rating if the experience improves.",Artizen by MW,['Pacific Rim restaurant'],"Counter-serve cafe offering daily changing Hawaiian lunch specials in spacious, modern surrounds.",1.1524632654689685e+20_1549822777061,1

The poke was delicately flavored with sweet white onions and a delicious chili oil, and was serve with a bowl of perfectly cooked and aggressively seasoned rice. Short ribs are rich and tender, and the soy based sauce combines with the rice for a complete experience.

Hopefully theres another time I'll try to eat here, but for now I'll pass. Maybe ill stick to eating in next time.",Times Coffee Shop,['Breakfast restaurant'],Simple setup in Koolau Center turning out traditional American daytime dishes with a Hawaiian touch.,1.1262294485560466e+20_1578774524197,0

4065,4,"I love this place.  Man.... I used to eat at this place when they were across Windward Mall.  And then they closed down and I never knew what happened to them.  All these years... maybe like 10 years or something, I never know they were in Temple Valley until my dad wanted to meet there for breakfast.

I ordered their fried rice and a side of potato salad, both my favorites from before.  The fried rice was delicious.  The potato salad wasn't as great as I remembered it.  Think I needed to just add a little more salt and it would have been perfect, but my son and husband liked it so it's still a winner in my book.

Also, they forgot to serve our dessert so we called other manager to ask the server to bring our dessert. In addition to this we had made a reservation to the window seat but the manager at the front moved our seat without a single explanation so we had to sit right in front of the entrance which made us get cold. Also, they forgot to set the table setting like plates so we had to eat cold bread when the plates finally came.

Food is good, prices are fair and portions are decent. Been going here a while and occasionally that change in cooks makes the food inconsistent but generally they are our standby Chinese food spot.  Favorites are salted fish fried rice, mapo tofu, eggplant with minced pork, garlic chicken over cake noodle, black bean clams, salt and pepper dished (port chops, chicken or squid all tasty).  Staff has been really friendly and helpful but speaking Chinese probably helps the cause but our friends who don't speak still get good service.

4266,5,"This place is something most people don't think of as a historical place to visit.  It is an important part of Hawaii's history leading up to modern times, but it wasn't until recent years did become open to the public for free tours every Thursday.

The tour space is very limited, so it is a good idea to plan in advance.  You can easily book online to confirm available space.  Again, it is free, so this is a no lose deal.  The docents take you back in time to really help you understand everything about the property and events that have happened over time.

Being located next to the State Capital, Iolani Palace, and State Art Museum, you can make a day of it just touring Hawaii's history in one walkable area.

4467,5,"If you are tired of Pho, you have to try King of Thai Boat Noodles for that noodle soup experience at a whole different level.

Don't get me wrong, I still love pho noodles, but it is kind of the same after a while. Thai boat noodles offer richer soup bases and more varieties of noodle choices to change it up from the simplicity of pho noodle soups.

The Combination Beef Noodle Soup offers a rich and spicy dark broth loaded with hearty chunks of different beef. It is truly filling and satisfying, so you won't be hungry for a while.

For something way different, there is the Yen Ta Fo Noodle Soup. It offers lots of seafood in a red bean based broth that is impossible to describe, but something you must try. I am not sure if it is for everyone and probably need to be in the mood for it, but very good all the same.

The Crab Meat Fried Rice is a great dish to share. It has lots of crab meat that has been perfectly fried with onions in the rice. Simple on the ingredients, which is perfect for highlighting the crab meat flavor that comes out.

Of course they make classic Thai Green Papaya Salad, which is made fresh to order. The balance of ingredients really makes this dish a perfect starter or side with you order.

The for experienced: I've done all of their rooms now and would only recommend one of them to a friend (Y2K). The other rooms had broken or missing clues. We tried to challenge a couple we know but when we did the same room an entire set of clues was left out. If you're bored and really need a scratch your escape room itch give it a go.

4870,2,"I placed an order online and was told that there was a 15-minute wait for carry out.  When I arrived at the store, the sole employee was telling customers that he was the only person working that day, and that he had not yet started to make pizzas for customers who had already been waiting over 45 minutes.  Finally, nearly 80 minutes after I placed the order, it was ready.

What really bothered me about this experience, though, was the fact that as new customers came into the store to place an order, they were told that their pizza would be ready in 15 minutes, when the employee clearly knew this to be false--one of these customers had been there an hour when I left. I can handle waiting for a pizza--backups happen and staff shortages can be unexpected.

Aesthetics very clean, modern and borderline industrial. We were seated at the bar side and the place holders were locally sourced so that in itself is a plus. We were offered the restaurant week menu as well as the house menu. We opted for restaurant week and glad for it. The RW menu included two options for each course, a 3-course menu (see picture). The pictures say it all and likely does not do it justice. Each dish was well thought out, paired well with wine options and delectable but very filling.

The cocktails are a good choice, and I'd suggest you try kind of a omakase with their bartender. I had some drinks which were on par with the excellent food, capped off by this inventive tea cocktail which I enjoyed greatly.

There are many beautiful glass pieces in here for decor and also some functional ones light sconces and bar lighting.

I like that the workshop is active and you can see live demonstrations of how they make the glass.

It's very beautiful and some of the best craftsmanship I saw.  I also so their items at the Four Seasons hotel at Wailea where I stayed where they were featured one day in the open air space and at the ferry landing the day I arrived in a few of the art galleries.

5241,4,"This italian restaurant was a great experience.
The food was much better than expected, and the decor was very nice.
For the food...
The table bread was warm and delicious, light crust and fluffy inside.
I ordered the sausage and meatball with rigatoni; The red sauce was outstanding, the pasta was perfect, and the meatball was alright, but the sausage left me a little disappointed. I never seem to like restaurant meatballs, no one will ever live up to my Nana's cooking so I'll let that slide. Also I'm not a fan of sweet sausage as it is, but it was just bleh for me either way.
The grated cheese added a lot to the flavor of my meal, I'd suggest having them heap it on.

As for the restaurant itself...
The telephone at the front door was constantly ringing at a high volume for the duration of my visit. I understand that they need to take orders and reservations over the phone, but it doesn't need to be on high volume when someone should be there watching the door anyway.
My servers however, were very cheerful and attentive. It definitely improved my experience.

A shorter jungle hike(1 mile each way) with only a couple of steep climbs to access both waterfalls. Water shoes work best. At places the trail is muddy but not horrible. We got there at 715 and there was only one other person. We had both sets of falls to ourselves. The first set of falls was HORRENDOUS for mosquitoes, and at the second set there were none. Supposedly you can cliff jump into the first set but it looked pretty risky. The second set we swam in and there is a rope swing.(there is one dangerous boulder in the water so have someone stand by it while the other person swings in so they dont hit it) When we got back to the car at 945 the parking area was full and there were many people on the trail as we hiked out.

2 stars.  Food here is yucky to the point of inedible. Pastry is okay and drinks are good here.

Ordered a plate lunch with mushroom and chicken.  The chicken was meh and I really liked the mushrooms but the rice had hard bits mixed in like left over from the night before.  Shame on them, can't get decent rice here. In the trash it goes.

Ordered pizza with a custard drink.  I loved the drink but the pizza was the saltiest thing ever.  I thought cook was having an off day so I gave it another chance.  I  ordered pizza again for lunch  but requested ""no salt"".  The second time was even saltier. Yuck!  Zero stars , trash can buddy.

I think getting sugary donuts are okay but stay away from the other foods they offer.  I would strongly recommend you eat dinner and lunch elseware.

5807,1,I do not wish to give it rating. When Starbucks starting out one of the greatest things they had a reputation for was an absolutely clean restroom Pep Boys open to everyone whether you got a cup of coffee or you didn't. I used to frequent the one by my store but I would go there with sales reps I would go there with people that just needed to talk after they get away with her restroom they did away with my business. I only go to Starbucks for coffee but I have to do right next to it. They have gotten away with the restroom and they're all location do you want I did this back open up all your locations with great clean restrooms like how you started out and I believe your business could make a comeback. So glad your president of the company jet step down that was the biggest favor he did to everyone of us that's the only reason I try not to support you because of your stand on traditional marriage.

The servings are enough for a meal and leftovers, if you prefer leftovers. It was busy but the line was moving quickly but people were constantly getting in line. Fresh noodles are prepared right in front you, taste was delicious. Would definitely recommend, however with how busy the restaurant was, there was no one paying attention to takeout orders. They were placed near an exit and if anyone grabbed them, no employee would have noticed. I walked in, and stood waiting for someone to acknowledge I was there for a takeout order.

Well guess what? It was definitely not crispy. I pulled it off in one big chunk and put it on my plate. My wife got the beef noodles and was also very disappointed. But like I said we must be in the minority because everyone else seems to enjoy it. I did get the Katsu chicken and enjoy that quite a bit. In hindsight I wish I had just got that.

6076,5,"I don't get too excited for udon but this place was so raved about so we had to check it out. The line everyday is almost out the door at all hours. However, at 10am to 11am is the best time to go for the shortest wait right before the lunch rush. We were able to come here twice without much wait.

They have a good system to help the line go faster. It's a cafeteria style as you go through the line. The first step is letting the staff know which udon you want and it's quickly prepared. Grab a tray and put your udon on it and move along to all the tempura goodies.

You can pick whichever tempura you like. They also served musubi that's ready to go. You pay at the end of the line. Get your utensils and sauces on your own and grab a seat anywhere. Inside is a bit small but they make the best of the space they have.

The Nukutama udon and the Niku udon were both delicious. Very subtle and sweet taste. Portion was  just right. The udon noodles were thick and chewy. I also love the shrimp, zucchini, veggie mixed, and sweet potato. Goes great with the udon and will fill you up. Everything was relatively a good price for really good quality.

For first timers, get the Kake Udon, you can't go wrong.

Order by the number for noodles that are piping hot, and then proceed to grab an assortment of tempura, musubi, and onigiri.

Noodles are made in house and you can watch the entire process as you walk by...noodle texture is just right. The broth is on the sweeter side...not my thing but still good. The curry option is also great and helps to offset a sweeter style broth.

It is harder to bring a larger group in as tables seat a max of 4 and you're not guaranteed to be able to find tables in the same area for a large party. My advice, get there before a rush.

The food is udon and tempura, so hard to screw up for a chain which is very popular and established in Japan.  Overall, the food was tasting great and just like it tastes in Japan.

The selection of tempura was bigger that what you normally get in Japan; but it seems that this shop sells the most tempura out of all branches of this franchise; testimony to the popularity of tempura among non-Japanese? I believe so.

Make sure that you plan the table hunting well as the restaurant is crowded and if you don't send one person to find a table while you pay; you will be walking around with a heavy plate of udon and tempura among quite narrow isles...",Marukame Udon Waikiki,"['Udon noodle restaurant', 'Restaurant']",Guests order at the counter at this casual Japanese restaurant specializing in noodle soup.,1.062981545967756e+20_1575810184115,1

The place can be crowded and queues can be long. To minimise waiting, I recommend: (1) come before 6pm for dinner (After 7pm, line gets horribly long), (2) decide what you want while queuing and not decide at the counter, (3) eat quickly (If you want to chat, go to Starbucks or Coffee Bean after dinner), (4) clear your own tray after your meal to make space for others, (5) leave via the back door beside the tray clearing bay to avoid congestion within the eatery

Saw that prices for the udon were significantly cheaper than in California, so we were stoked about that. The process is pretty much the same where you order your udon first, then pick out your tempura and musubi a la carte and then pay for your order.

The only big difference is that instead of adding in your own green onions after receiving your bowl, they already add it for you here. I tried the same niku (beef) udon at both locations and noticed that the amount of beef at Marukame was less than from Marugame, but I think that Marukame knew how to portion the ratio of meat to udon better.",Marukame Udon Waikiki,"['Udon noodle restaurant', 'Restaurant']",Guests order at the counter at this casual Japanese restaurant specializing in noodle soup.,1.1627851349242905e+20_1567287026506,1

Their soft boil eggs is AWESOME. Udon is very chewy (not too soft or hard). Soup base taste good (not too salty). Beef taste very good with onion taste.

We tried both hot and cold udon. I like the cold a bit more just because the temperature outside. However, both are good.

6736,4,"My favorite udon restaurant in Honolulu. The main reason I like this restaurant is mostly because of the fact that it's cafeteria-based. During meal hours, you'll definitely find yourself waiting in a long line, but it flows pretty well. It's great because you can kinda customize your meal to exactly how you want it. Since the restaurant is cafeteria-based, you won't have to worry about anyone glaring at you if you don't tip. The only main downfall to this restaurant is that you feel as if you can't stay too long and a bit rushed. So if you're looking for an inexpensive place with great udon to just eat then go, I'd say this is your best bet.",Marukame Udon Waikiki,"['Udon noodle restaurant', 'Restaurant']",Guests order at the counter at this casual Japanese restaurant specializing in noodle soup.,1.0588046313439106e+20_1365268411462,1

6738,4,"I've heard of this Udon shop during our previous visit but didn't stop in because it was so crowded.

I can't stand waiting in lines because I'm impatient but did so here because of what I've heard.

I knew the place had to be good because of the long lines out the door.

On this trip, there was just a minimal line.  I say minimal, because the wait was about 30 minutes.

The line actually went quite fast and It also helped that we arrived before the big dinner rush, which came shortly

I was also worried about getting a table but in the end, we managed to get seating.  I guess I do all the worrying for the family and everyone else just goes with the flow.

The first thing we did was to place our order on the kind of Udon we wanted.  I chose a beef broth with several different types of tempura add ons.

For the side, I selected the Nigiri with plum.

To watch the noodle chefs doing their thing, preparing the many Udon bowls in the open kitchen is amazing.

The restaurant here is like a ""cafeteria"" in which you go down the line, first selecting the type of Udon, then making a selection of what to add with your Udon.

They have over a dozen toppings to choose from so there is something for everyone.

""In a nutshell, the Udon was very fresh and very good.""

Bottom line; on this visit, we waited less than 30 minutes to get in but well worth the wait.

The food was excellent and made right in front of you and the musubi side dish was just wonderful as well.

By far one of the most affordable places to eat.

Is there a wait here? Ya, most probably. But the line moves quickly. How the logistics work is this: you wait in line. When it is your turn, order your udon preference, and to avoid confusion, order by the number assigned to the variant. Then, take your bowl of udon and proceed down the line to the variety of tempura items and select the ones that strike your fancy. Approach the musabe rice balls and decide if you want to stuff yourself to the max, and if so, pick up a freshly made musabi. Finally, pay and you'll complete the ordering process. Grab some tempura sauce at the adjacent table and navigate to an table and tuck in.

There is FREE water available. No need to buy bottled.

My favorite is the ontama udon (cold) which has a soft boiled egg and tempura flakes on top.  Getting it cold doesn't mean ice cold but more like lukewarm.  Not getting it hot keeps the noodles a wee bit chewier.

Its cafeteria style so you order and bring your food to a table to eat.  The line often is out the door but it moves fast.  Even if the line wraps you won't wait more than 30 min and its worth the wait.

If you want to avoid the line, they have the same menu but a little note limited for breakfast.  Or come at 11am when they reopen for lunch with their full menu.

They have like 3 menus in the store, 2 while you're waiting outside and one when you go in as a reference when you order but no instructions on how you order. The employees didn't seem happy or concerned enough to help so lots of trial and error. It's a restaurant designed mainly for eat in, and I found the take-out route is cumbersome, though maybe that was just because I made so many mistakes. Like I asked for extra noodle, and the guy just never said anything, not even sure if he put an extra or what. It didn't matter, I just need that response like ""hey we don't do that"" or ""okay I put an extra there"". Then after the noodle guy there's the topping guy which I learned is the person you talk to if you want extra toppings. I didn't know this and the noodle guy never said anything to me about it. He just looked pissed cause I told him my whole order and the extra topping that I wanted. So I got to the register without the extra topping, and I had to ask the lady there that there was supposed to be an egg on top. They were nice enough to get me the egg, but like I said, I wouldn't have been in that predicament if I knew how to order or at least someone told me who I talk to about the toppings. But I gotta cut them slack since it's always busy there, and they probably are sick of stupid people like me. But yeah, I really would have appreciated the help and friendliness would have been nice too. But that is what you get for cheap udon I guess?",Marukame Udon Waikiki,"['Udon noodle restaurant', 'Restaurant']",Guests order at the counter at this casual Japanese restaurant specializing in noodle soup.,1.0928066116253326e+20_1485632740565,1

The broth was a hit for all four us in the family. However, my daughter, who loves soba, somen, ramen, etc. didn't really care for the thickness of the udon noodles. Similar with my son - so I ate theirs. My wife thought it was good, but said ""don't really need to go there again"". I really liked it.

6972,4,"The only hotel I stayed in my whole time in Hawaii (Airbnb for the rest), for me the cost performance here was definitely lower. Definitely a good location, and big room. Included full kitchenette and separate bathroom and bedroom. I was informed at checkin there is a free shuttle to the Ala Moana Centre and towel rental for the beach, but only staying one night I did not utilize these services.

I found the air conditioning to be inadequate given the large room size. Since the unit was located in the living room area, I found the circulation did not reach the separate bedroom as much, leaving the bedroom a bit warm. Luckily the bedroom had a ceiling fan that helped, and I left the bedroom patio door open a bit as well.

Bed was nice a soft, great pillows. I was a bit disappointed there was not a TV in the bedroom, I wanted to relax after a long day in bed at night and watch TV, but unfortunately the TV was only in the living room.

The bathroom was the most dated part of the room, but was adequate, shower was hot and I liked the provided soaps and shampoo. I was a bit confused at how to turn on the shower, but it is one of those pull out knobs.

Since I took a photo tour the next day, I was able to iron my outfits I wanted to wear here beforehand, which was a plus.

Only 2 other people when u went, which meant I had one small pool to relax in for myself. Pele's chair itself was beautiful, but I saw it, took a pic, and was ready to move on. Still, interesting enough, especially since there doesn't seem to be as much lava rock in general on Oahu. Also convenient that the Makapu'u lighthouse trail starts from the same parking lot.

Bring real hiking shoes if you plan to take this latter segment, as flip flops are inappropriate and dangerous here if the trail is wet or muddy with loose groundcover.

Able to taste some berries growing in the wild. Lava tubes are a site to see. Highly recommend the VIP tour if you're going in the off season.

Instead of sausage with chunks of pineapple, it was more like a sausage with a nice sweetness to it. I'm not sure I really tasted any pineapple in there but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Plus the potatoes were perfectly crispy, and they give a pretty big portion.

My sister had the eggs benedict, which she said she also liked. But she enjoyed my dish too, so much so that she said she'll order that one the next time she's back.

The only thing I didn't like was that we felt kind of rushed. I understand brunch is over at 3, but they didn't have to start mopping up the place and placing chairs on the tables while we were eating. Not exactly a relaxing experience. That being said, if you do come for brunch, make sure you come earlier so that they don't try to push you out!",Moena Cafe,"['Hawaiian restaurant', 'Restaurant']",Daytime cafe offering gourmet Hawaiian-influenced meals in a modern white-accented setting.,1.0370759163327203e+20_1541452868569,1

7831,3,"This was a fun brunch spot in Kamakana Alii.  We had some confusion about whether or not they took reservations and the hostess never really cleared this up.
There was a short wait of about 25 minutes and the side walk outside is a pretty busy thoroughfare between the parking lot and the mall. It was a little annoying to have to constantly walk away and back as others needed to pass. Having pagers with a longer range, text messaging, or a specific waiting area would help.
Our table only had 3 chairs when the hostess took us to our table and so 1 of the 4 people awkwardly stood around until she brought another chair. There was another table with 4 chairs set up so maybe there was some sort of miscommunication?
Once all 4 of us were seated, the waitress came over almost immediately and didn't give us more than a minute to peruse the menu and asked for our drink order. She then left before asking our preferences on milk with coffee. When she returned with cream for all, 2 of us asked for alternatives for milk (which is specifically listed on the menu).
The food was delicious, the presentation pretty, and the menu has a nice variation for different dietary needs.

8193,4,"Was in the mood for something spicy and nothing I had already been to seemed appealing and then I remembered passing by this place a few time and figured I would give it a chance.  Good call.  The food was amazing and totally hit the spot for both my craving of spicy food as well as my hunger.

Since it was just myself, I stuck to just one dish.  Got the Fried Fish with Red Curry Sauce.  Unfortunately, the brown Jasmin rice was not ready yet, so I got the regular Jasmin rice.  Still good all the same, but just wanted the healthier option.  The dish was great.  It was a perfect balance of fish, vegetables, and curry sauce.  I also like it spicy, so when I requested Thai hot, it came out hot!

To go with this flavor bomb of a dish, I got their Thai Iced Tea.  It was perfectly prepared with the right amount of tea and not to much condensed milk. Had a gentle sweetness and the tea made for a perfect combination to cleanse the palate after the zesty curry.

Service was very friendly and attentive.  Atmosphere was the typical South East Asian fare and very cozy.  It seemed very popular since I did arrive at about 11:30am and it started to get very busy shortly after I sat down and ordered.

I want to go back and try it again, but not alone so that I can try more dishes and do it family style.  If you ask if I recommend this place, the answer is yes. Go check it out.

The crazy part about it is that it says exactly what it should be on the label... it just wasn't right.  And this place isn't crazy busy compared to places like Waikele, Waikiki, or Pearlridge.  To me, its just carelessness.  They don't take the time to fully read and verify.

A couple times I went home and my husbands drink was wrong but by then it was too late.  So I started checking while I was there and had them correct it on the spot.  Most of the time, they would correct it on the spot.  Sometimes they would put my cup at the end and make me wait (might as well, right, they already got my money).

First, the staff was super friendly and helpful.
We asked a couple of questions to get a feel of what we wanted.
My husband and I split the King Crab  Combo, and we got a pound of shrimp for the kids as well. One of my sons also got the chicken wing basket. We got the cajun and garlic butter seasoning on everything.

9001,1,"Let me say this first. This restaurant used to be my to-go place for crab and other seafood. And they also have very yummy new york steak for lunch only. It was one of my favorite.
It has been quite a few months since I ate there the last time. I don't remember it ever being so horrible. The steak looked smaller than ever and had absolutely no flavor. I ordered spice level volcanic with garlic butter to go with my seafood. The bag came with barely any sauce in it let along volcanic. There was barely any spice! I usually scoop all the sauce from the bottom of the bag and put it in my rice. And i could barely scoop any this time. I also found few blanken shrimp mixed in there. See photo attached. You'd think if they see spoiled ones they at least have the decency to take it out? Nope, just put them in anyways and hope I don't notice them.
The best thing about that experience is the popcorn chicken and cajun fries. AT A SEAFOOD PLACE!!!

After ordering some fried oysters with Cajun fries, the waitress brought out some condiments. This seems like a very easy thing that you can't mess up right? I mean it's ketchup, ranch, and tartar sauce. It's premade in a factory far far away. But these were obviously very old and left in open cups in a fridge. The tartar sauce was hard and yellowing, and very frozen. The ranch had old dried red sauce on the lips of the cups like they had been reusing them.

But wait, there's more dissapointing material coming;
The oysters. One of the very few options they had left, were HORRIBLE. The absolute worst I have had in my entire life.

My husband and I had to drop folks off at the airport tonight and we never celebrate the holiday on the day of because every place that serves food is normally super busy.  Despite that, the food tonight was excellent.

I ordered orange chicken, beef broccoli, and Beijing beef.  My husband ordered beef with green beans and honey walnut shrimp.  The food must have just been made because the orange chicken and Beijing beef were crispy on the outside rather than soggy.  I would have given them 5 stars except they ran out of brown rice and the steamed veggies had to be made and I waited for the new batch to come out since there wasn't enough for the two plates I ordered.

I can never find orange chicken that tastes quite like theirs.  Its this perfect combination of sweet, salty, and tanginess.    The honey walnut shrimp is awesome because its kind of like shrimp canton but with a more milder flavored sauce and the walnuts give it the right amount of sweet and crunch.  As for the cream cheese rangoons...I dont know what it is about it, but I just love them.  The creaminess with the crunch of the fried won ton gets me every time.

That way there was no miss communication. The first time I didnt make a big deal out of it and they did it again and I told her take it back because that is not what I ordered and she was hesitant but she took it back.

My son and I sat without a drink for most of the time, and our waitress only came twice to see what we wanted to order that wasnt on the Conyer belt, and once we had to walk over to the waiter. The calamari was so dry and salty that in was almost inedible, but we ate it because they charge per plate of food left over, on top of the 45.00 per person. My daughter and I wanted cheesecake, we were brought out two nearly frozen pieces. I sliced mine thinly myself to even be able to eat it.

I probably could have eaten the entire pizza but saved half of it for next day's lunch!!! I read there could be a little wait but my coworker got there around 5 and we got seated at the front window.

It was a Thursday at 12:30pm - it wasn't very busy but our service was very slow.  I ordered the avocado shrimp salad and it was okay.  The avocados were fresh, but the shrimp they used looked and tasted like cocktail shrimp you can buy frozen from Costco.  They didn't taste fresh, and they had a rubbery texture to them when you bit into them.  Their bread on the other hand is very delicious!  I wouldn't recommend this spot for large parties of 6 or more, they don't really have the tables to accommodate such a large party size, but anything less seems like a good idea.

9968,3,"Hawaii's restaurant scene is top-notch and only continues to get better but why oh why is it so hard to find a great restaurant with great food and reasonable prices open on Sunday night? And, especially one that is friendly to both vegetarians and meat lovers..? Sigh.

My vegetarian friends were visiting from the mainland and we decided Arancino would be the right place for us. I like this area of Waikiki because the restaurant is on a short side street and you don't have to drive deep in the mix. The restaurant offers validated parking in the Bank of Hawaii lot which is perfect since i drive a tank and the lot has wide-enough stalls.

The restaurant doesn't take reservations and I knew there would be a wait so our party agreed on meeting early - we got there at about 5:45 and were seated by 6:30. We could've maybe grabbed a quick drink at Yardhouse but instead, we decided to kill time with a leisurely walk around the block and popped into a couple stores on Lewers St. When we made it back, we waited only about 10 minutes and our party was ready to be seated.
My BF and I split the spaghetti con tobiko e calamari and pizza peperoni e salsiccia.Both were fantastic! I loved the crunch the tobiko added to the dish, and the pizza crust was beautifully crispy.
