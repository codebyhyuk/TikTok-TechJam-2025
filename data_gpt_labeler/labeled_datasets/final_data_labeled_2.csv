The food here was pretty good.  I'm Filipino, but like 2nd generation, so the names of a lot of the food I couldn't tell you.  All I can say is that it was all very good.  There was about 10 different dishes and we tried them all.  My son and I liked the pancit and I really enjoyed the calamari and fried fish.  I liked the lecheon kuwali, but it wasn't as good as Thelma's in my opinion.

The staff here sucked.  I was given a soda, but no one ever came back to refill my drink.  The staff serving our side of the restaurant was separate from the normal wait staff.  I'm sure their tip was included in the price to rent the place out, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to earn your tip.  I saw all our wait staff standing around and giggling up in the front and checking their cell phones.

I would consider coming back here again for just a meal, but from what I've been told it's just a fancy Filipino food restaurant.  Combine that with the experience I had with the staff, I would much rather prefer Thelma's to satisfy my Filipino food cravings and save some money.","Max's Restaurant, Cuisine of the Philippines, Waipahu","['Filipino restaurant', 'Asian restaurant', 'Southeast Asian restaurant']",Filipino restaurant chain popular for its fried chicken served with banana ketchup.,1.171807380630962e+20_1471916953599,1

The tables and seating arrangement is spacious but the environment cold and hard feeling. Not table cloth fancy but almost. Staff dressed up but patrons wore all assortment of styles, giving the impression of a casual atmosphere. Service was fast, polite and precise yet lacking warmth that added to the harder edge of Roy's ambiance.

The bar area is ample and well stocked. The sangria was the best I've had on Maui. The wine selection was regionally varied and above the fold.

The dragon roll appetizer was crispy outside, with well balanced flavors that didn't overpower the eel. Tricky to prepare and delicious! This was our favorite plate of the evening.

Our Duck 2 ways was equally flavorful and tender. The sweet sauce is what really shines in that dish.

We wrapped up with a molten cake that was not only beautiful in presentation but more delicious than I remember most cakes of its type.

Do NOT eat more than one serving though, as the fish does not digest fat solids, which means they will transfer to you, so you can get horrifying bathroom-related visitations that will dent your vacation spirit. Just eat one plate and don't eat any more. The canoe for two is also similarly delicious yet frighteningly expensive. I do not care about golf, though it overlooks a nice course if you're into that. (I golf a lot, but only to keep my sweet father company, not because I enjoy it.

Luckily my girlfriend didnt mind and finished it otherwise I would have put my fork down and tried something else. Service was quick. Restrooms were clean and parking was easily available and the walk from the car to Roy's was very short. Servers started off attentive but maybe backed off cause we were engaged with each other. Eventually I had to wait for the bartender to come around and flag him down for another drink. I plan on coming back and trying a full meal rather than pupus. One thing to note and this has no effect on my rating or bias but there were children at the bar with their parents. I have only a few hours away from the children myself so going to a romantic location sitting at the bar and having kiddos around had me on guard. I'm very thankful that the parents that were at the bar with their children had very well behaved children and kudos to those parents for raising well mannered children.

We had the red snapper and the mahi mahi.  The mahi mahi came out as sword fish. We were not told until it came to our table. We should have been told that when we ordered.

Our fish was very bland in the beginning and slightly overcooked but as the meal went on, both fish took the flavors to the accompanied foods, making the fish taste better and better until the last bite.

For dessert, we had the lava cake.  Great way to end a lighter fish meal.

I had the vegan tofu and veggies. Can't say it was that impressive. Probably is better the original way with the crusted tofu but that had egg for binding purposes so I just had the tofu grilled. Lacked any flavor at all. The veggies were good tho!

11108,1,"The restaurant is beautiful and the food is very good. That said, if you are not a guest at the Hyatt expect to be treated like a second class patron. Let me explain. I reserved a table three weeks ago, requesting a view table of one of the many koi ponds around the restaurant. When we arrived 20 minutes before our reservation, dressed appropriately, we watched as hotel guests with no reservations  were seated before us. We were asked by two different hostesses where we were staying. I guess cementing our status as second class. When they finally seated us 25 minutes later we were seated under hot lights in the middle of the room. No view except of other diners. We sat under those lights for five minutes before requesting a new table, preferably a cooler table with less direct lighting. We were moved two tables over, still in the middle of the room but thankfully out from the bright direct lights. The food was good. The service by the waitstaff was excellent. My appetite was ruined by our treatment so I had my wife order for me since I really didn't want to spend any money here. The only reason I stayed was that my mother-in-law had requested this restaurant and we wanted to make her visit to the island special. We were excited to try the restaurant out. Due to the seating arrangement and the hierarchy imposed by the hostesses I will never patronize a Hyatt property in the future. We have patronized many fine restaurants and establishments around the world and have never ever been treated like we were at this restaurant. We will spend our money elsewhere.

I haven't had any good Italian food on the island untill I ate here!

They serve complimentary fresh baked bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar

I'm not a big tomato fan, but the Bruschetta was a delicious and refreshing appetizer.

The Lobster Ravioli is a must try. It's perfectly balanced with fresh lobster and creamy white sauce.

I had the Hazelnut Ice cream for dessert and it's basically the best gelato I've ever had. Think about Nutella Icecream!

The owner Fabrizio, originally from Roma, and is one of the nicest people I've met on the island, very personable. He even escorted us out!

I highly recommend this place, and will definitely be back!

Mahalos, Fabrizio and staff for the amazing experience!

11510,5,"One of the best small coffee shops in Honolulu. Aussie-owned (""arvo"", get it? Except they are open in the mornings), so yes, you CAN get vegemite toast here.

Accept credit cards using Foursquare.

Fresh ingredients, as locally sourced as possible.

Lovely outdoor seating. Very limited indoor seating. Shares a space with the Paiko flower shop. Often a line starting around 10 o'clock, so get there early if you can.

Definitely spring for the loaded avocado toast, the smoked salmon toast, the lavender latte. It might seem pricey for toast, but no, it's not just toast. Food quality is good, shop is clean, and portions of higher-priced items are generous. Expect the full quarter pound or so of very decent quality smoked salmon on your salmon toast. Food is served on wooden planks, so um, those capers? Yeah, they'll roll, so be prepared to lose a few or grab a fork and knife at the front. Edible flowers garnish most dishes. Beautiful presentation, though often very messy. Order inside, get your table marker, grab an outdoor table, and they will bring the food out to you. Grab extra napkins at the front or bring your own small bag of hand wipes. You'll need them.

Cuppa comes with coffee art, but not obnoxious or interferes with the flavor. Matcha latte is very strong here. If you're looking for a watered-down Starbucks version, go there. They do slow cold filtered coffee here that is very very good.",Arvo Cafe,"['Coffee shop', 'Brunch restaurant']","Hip, plant-filled coffee shop offering light fare such as toast with unique toppings.",1.025263459229875e+20_1483735248948,1

I'm not a fan of the Lavender latte (it's VERY lavender, like you're drinking essential oils but hey, what did I expect haha).

Also, there's very very very little seating so if you come at a breakfast or lunch hour, or you come on a weekend, expect to wait a very long time for a seat or have to take your meal to-go.

My kids ordered Mac n cheese, but it was fancy Mac n cheese. They did not like it and ended up just eating off of our plates. I got the steamed fish which was soft and tender. My grandpa got the whole fried fish, which he said was delicious. They have a complimentary raspberry chocolate dessert and I also got the cheesecake. It was soft and creamy.

11614,5,"Exquisite!  We have not dined here for some years -- just happenstance, I suspect, and were looking for a place to feed a group of ten family and friends in for the Thanksgiving holidays.  Since we had just been to Michel's a few weeks previously, we had to choose something different, and just happened to think of this place because it was close to Waikiki (where most of the group was staying) but not IN Waikiki.  We ordered several appetizers -- four different types,  two or three orders each -- so that everyone would have a taste of everything.  The foie gras was incredible, the escargot and crab exceptional as was the chicken sate with naan and the little ahi poke in cones were so good that I never got to taste it because the others ate it all before I could get to it.  We each ordered whatever we liked for a main course and, incredibly, they all arrived more or less together.  My scallops were cooked to perfection, and since I know how difficult it is to get scallops just slightly underdone, it is a marvel how this kitchen managed to put out all the meals at once and still have the scallops perfect.  I was told the kurobuta pork ""osso bucco"" was terrific as well as the oxtail soup, although the eaters of that confessed that the other things looked and tasted so good (we passed forks) that they would have eaten something a trifle more substantial had they thought about it.   And, the small deep fried fish -- beautifully executed and the taste to die for.  The desserts were equally up to caliber, although, since I've been on a diet for the past three months, I didn't indulge.

11637,3,"The food was excellent.   It was very tasty and not something you can not just get at any restaurant.  The seating and ambience was a turn off.  We had a 530 seating in an empty restaurant but hostess sat us next to an already occupied table.  It was obvious they treated us like a ""number"".  Cause the next couple that walked was seated on the other table right next to us and again...in an empty restaurant!  So they had a total if 4 groups all crammed into 4 tables in one corner of the restaurant, when the rest of the tables in the restaurant were EMPTY.  The tables are so close together that you can hear everyone's conversation around you.  Not my idea of an intimate dinner.  Instead I was left hearing others talk about their family problems or their next real estate adventure. I get that the restaurant is small and they want to get as many tables as they can, but the seating ruined a nice dinner out. My hubbie loved the food, but I won't go back.

It's one of those little hole in the walls run by mom and pop that I usually love and almost feverishly endorse, but the ""famous"" ahi tataki left me underwhelmed, although the fish was fresh and delicious. I'm going to chalk it up to flavor preference as the sauce it came with was too heavy of a shoyu flavor whereas i usually like it more light with daikon and ponzu.

So I just went into the store and mentioned I was here to pick up an order and the very nice man goes ohh yea we tried calling you ( my husband at work). I very embarrassed respond ohh yes he apparently hit carry out verses delivery. And omgosh OUT OF NO WHERE he offered to remake our pizzas!!!!!!! My son was so happy! He loves pizza hut pizza.

Like many Starbucks, they are consistent, the staff was quite nice and the place was relatively always a nice and clean Starbucks.  This place will even brew you a fresh cup of Kona coffee for any of you coffee connoisseurs out there reading this.

Overall, it has pretty much anything you would expect in a Starbucks.  The prices are not any different compared to what we've paid in Portland, Oregon.  The only drawback, if any, would be there are no bathrooms.  Regardless, you should be there for the coffee and not the toilets.

We ordered take out every week.
Lately it's been very inconsistent.
In the Phad Thai Noodles with Shrimp add tofu.
The tofu was cold and raw.
Shrimp tails , sime with no shrimp on them.
Forgot the Chile sauce again.
I always ask for it up when ordering.
It's so unfortunate to see our favorite local restaurant in our area, go down the tubes like this.
Last time they blamed It on the chef being out of town.
But 3 times, is too much.

When Queen Victoria learned of this Injustice she dispatched Admiral Richard Thomas to the islands to restore sovereignty. On July 31st, 1843, pompous ceremonies were held restoring the Hawaiian Kingdom. From that time the plot of land on which the ceremonies took place has been known as Thomas Square. Kamehameha later officially designated the area after Thomas and in 1850 the area was enlarged. A fountain sits in the middle of the park and Banyan trees lend dignity to the foliage.""

When I went in they didn't have any available, but made me my own batch. They asked exactly what I wanted and made sure they used all clean bowls and cookware. I wanted to cry they were so kind and accommodating. I talked to them for awhile because of how awesome they were. Uncle Henry told me how the tuna was caught THAT DAY by the owner and he was slicing and dicing it right there. You can't get much fresher than that folks. Come here.

I had actually seen it in a local news report and thought the food looked good, but when I first attempted to go, found the parking lot full and passed that day. My second attempt was spontaneous, as I was driving by feeling the hunger pains of lunch time calling and the parking lot was clear, so I pulled right in.

That being said, arriving just before noon would probably be a good idea.  Shortly after I Got seated and ordered, I noticed the place quickly filling up and by the time I was leaving, there was no parking. It was a good sign that the place is popular.

They have a lot of Japanese favorite comfort foods that are popular with locals here in Hawaii.  It was pleasure to see they offered the ability to order both off the lunch and dinner menu when I came for lunch.  Many different options and portions to choose from depending on your hunger and tastes.

I really recommend the bento set special.  There are 2 sizes, the lunch and dinner. Which you order will depend on how hungry you, but both are quite substantial and offer a full tasting of different items freshly prepared and beautifully arranged on the serving tray.

Service there was very nice and attentive.  You felt a real sincere feeling from the servers that they care about your experience there.

I highly recommend! The only thing is they only take cash so be mindful of that. I ordered the Ahi with garlic, ribeye with garlic , and the mushroom chicken (which is there most popular dish).

14426,5,"This place gets a 5 star for it's food alone. My family and I have been going their for years and even to their original location before this one and we have always favored their dim sum over anywhere else in town.

The quality of their dim sum far surpasses everyone else for it's freshness and preparation. It is always a good value here, so it won't bust your budget to splurge on a big meal there. They have all the classics and then some for dim sum.

My favorites and must haves are as follows: Spareribs, Siu Mai or Shumai aka Porkhash in Hawaii, Shrimp Dumplings, Steamed Look Fun, Chicken Feet Tripe, jellyfish, Fried Garlic Eggplant, and of course Egg Custard for dessert. Of course there is a full menu of Chinese classics you can order from if you need something more. We like to get a plate of Choy Sum with Oyster Sause for some veggies and sometimes some Crispy Fried Noodles with Seafood if feeling hungry.

Most of the staff have been there a long time and may seem a little rough around the edges, but they know what they are doing. In a a busy place like this, there is no time for niceties and it shouldn't be expected. I don't mean that they are rude, they are just not going to bend all over you like a fancy restaurant.

The place has seen a lot of traffic over the years and it shows it in the overall condition of the restaurant, but I feel that it is clean and never had any problems eating there.

14622,1,"I Really hate to write a bad review expectantly a place I go and Frequent but there is a problem at this STARBUCKS??

CORPORATE SHOULD REALLY CHECK IN.. Why because I drink so much coffee and I choose Starbucks when ever I can if I have the option. BUT this Store takes the cake for bad Starbucks and I have been to them far and wide ....  There is NO PRIDE at this store the note I enter into when I arrive here is the general feeling of sadness.

SADNESS EXPLAINED:  You walk into this store from a DIRTY out door area,
CUSTOMERS: Then you find that all the tables are filled with sadly the Less fortunate, looking as if they are trying to pull the Charge Leach of the century, this being every table is filled with people who do not plan to leave the shop for some time.... certainty will be there longer than it will take for me to sip down a cup of coffee.

THE STAFF: Sadly this store again sad, seems they go through employees like I go through toilet paper and feel by there looks and how they are rushed and cramped in such a small space, bouncing around because most all new always, this store needs stability. The feeling as I get my change from the Guys behind the counter is SAD and I Drink my Sad cup of coffee.

The STORE ITS SELF:  Ok it smells of coffee and rest room in there ... I do not like to hang out here, the tables are uncomfortable and small limited and are not inviting to share ... I can think a multi billion dollar company that specializes in challenges like this store has not even attempted.
THE BATHROOM is NASTY it even after they clean it has a smell that I would rip the whole structure down and start over kind of smell.

Look I like Starbucks as much as the other and this is a great location.

Suggestions if I may?

1) get better seating as a handicapped person I like to sit and have a cup and inside and outside is nasty.

2) Hire a STAFF and KEEP them ... This location is to small for people who do not know what they are doing there is not room for the extra person to help the new. The staff here seems frustrated and seems to me as a manager in my career tells me there is not much of a leader here.

3) Come up with a schedule of events, put a little stage in and do events like open mic night and poetry readings.

Don't do things like make it even more uncomfortable by removing the plugs or something stupid like this ... Your looking to draw in the crowed at night as you can see the high time to go is in the morning only ...

this place is so perfect for a great neighborhood that will support events But Bare MIN

14689,2,"Very mediocre sushi at best. Coming from Colorado I expected the sushi in Hawaii to be the freshest, most flavorful sushi I have ever eaten. I was let down. I only ordered 3 sushi rolls. 2 if which were very basic. Spicy tuna and a rainbow roll. The 3rd was something that I picked which was supposedly a specialty roll which tasted like overcooked salmon with a nasty aftertaste. The spicy tuna was horrible until I pulled out the thin slices of carrot which they either soaked in some type of pickling solution or was rotted. After taking the carrot out the roll was eat able but with very little flavor. The rainbow roll was the only roll that had a decent taste but was still so bland that I had to soy sauce the thing to meet half of my expectation. I'm so disgusted with sushi on this island that I refuse to eat any more until I get back to Denver. Hard to believe that Colorado has superior sushi but it definitely does.

15004,5,"Regretfully, I haven't been here in years. Not much has changed over the years except several refreshes and the staff. They sure are consistent from when I first experienced Tanaka of Tokyo when I was a kid about 40 years ago and many times since, but for some reason didn't for for a long time until recently. Same great food and exceptional service as well as the overall experience.

This was always the go to place when we had family visiting from the mainland. I continued the tradition as an adult when I had visitors. There is no place I know of that offers a dinner and a show like Takana of Tokyo where the food is actually good. All those luaus for the tourist have horrible food and the settings are not comfortable at all.

I really like how their staff all greet and make sure you feel welcomed and taken care of during your time there. Even the manager pays you a visit. I must give a shoutout to the manager I met this time, Jamie Harada for keeping the experience going and for his professionalism as a restauranteur.

We got the Shogun which I think gives you the best food experience, but if you need to keep it a bit more budgeted, the Daimyo is also a good one to go with. There are cheaper options, but I think you loose out big time.  However, it is understandable that some people can't spend that much or have dietary restrictions.  I do recommend upgrading your meal to include the fried rice over the plain rice if that appeals to you.

So whether you are visiting or local, you will get a good meal here and have some fun at the same time. Itadakimasu!",Tanaka of Tokyo Central,['Japanese restaurant'],Chefs entertain grill-side at this upscale-casual Japanese steakhouse in Waikiki Shopping Plaza.,1.10224932759879e+20_1617316183180,

Bad:  While eating the salad that came before the meal; it felt weird in my mouth. While attempting to pull it out, it ended up being a really long hair.  The general manager didn't even compensate me for my meal.  He told me that he was going to investigate it... Hello! I do not care about your investigation.  Someone's hair was in my mouth!  I only stayed because it was my anniversary and my wife made the reservation.  Never again will I eat here.  It's the principle!  Do not eat here!!!
Edit:  They did comp the celebration packet which was chopsticks and a cake.. oh lets not forget the rice too.  Don't make me post the receipt!!    The hair came from someone and it wasn't my wife's hair if that is what you are insinuating.  Check my other reviews.  This is the only bad review that I have given out in while.

The Bad: Out of the staff only one member was personable.  Our orginal waitress seemed as through she didnt want our table.  She stated that someone else would help us then said nevermind I'll take you myself.  We started off with soft drinks, my wife drink was fine.  My lemonade came with about ""20 or more sugar ants"" floating in my cup.  I was very discreet when telling her that I had a cup full on ants.  She said Im not sure how they got there and got a new cup.  That was the last time she came to our table.

The Ugly: Even though I wasn't looking for a free handout, but it would have been a nice gesture to remove my drink from the bill.  Or at least have the manager come over to apologize for serving a cup of ANTS.  Sad part is the waitress that removed our plates and offered to show us the dessert menu was very nice.

Easy access right off king st is the awe inspiring Chef Mavro. Fresh top notch ingredients combined with true mastery and thoughtful execution. Simple and beautiful decor. It is expensive, but so is a Lamborghini and IT IS WORTH IT.
We had 9 courses and this was the food that must only had originally been served in heaven and like other mythic wonders, man stole them from the gods and brought them to share with mortal kind.

The elysian lamb is worth waging wars over. Hand raised lamb like wagyu are, the meticulous process yields only the finest result. With coconut and date chutneys, the sweet notes sing clearly while the parsnips vadouvan curry and essence of cilantro bring balance and poise to prevent oversweetness.

An epic ballad could be written for each course, from diver scallops to honeydew in champagne gelee.

The entire staff is warm and friendly.  You can tell that they all pride themselves on customer service!

If you are anything like me you are willing to search for that special place to convey the emotion you feel for the person or people you choose to dine with.

My sisters birthday is a special moment for me and my family so I wanted to ensure she felt like a queen.  I used opentable to reserve that special table, but due to a scheduling conflict I was unable to dine on her birthday.  I placed a call to Chef Mavro  within 24 hours of my reservations and they were happy to reschedule me(FREE OF CHARGE).

My first time dining with Chef Mavro was a experience I can never forget.  On the menu for desert were small carmel candies that left an impression of perfection.  I placed a call to the restaurant to confirm if the candies could be remade.  I was placed on hold and spoke directly to Chef Mavro.  We discussed in detail the menu for the night and he suggested I stick with the assigned menu desserts.

I realized the night of the dinner I would be running late, and placed a call to the front desk to confirm they would inform my party of my tardiness.  ""Sure Giovanni we will be happy to entertain your guest, until you arrive.""  I was relieved to arrive before my guest and ensure my sister table looked ""perfect""

I chose the 6 course meal for us with the wine pairings and could not be happier with presentation.  The highlight of the night was the hand made birthday cake with a single candle.  She smiled in embarrassment but noticed the look on my face as tears  began to stream as the waiter placed a additional plate with 5 small hand made caramels with a simple note...""just for you Giovanni, thanks for coming back""

I highly recommend Chef Mavro for a unique dining experience second to none.

My saag paneer was the worst I've EVER eaten - I've had very oily, somewhat bland, etc. - everyone does it differently and I respect that, even if it's not always my favorite version, but THIS was pathetic. No cream, milk, ANYTHING to make it even remotely runny. It was a stiff bowl of dark green, but somehow had almost no flavor whatsoever. The ""paneer"" was difficult to find in the mass, but the few miserably tiny pieces I did locate were dried up and brown as if they'd been baked in the desert sun for ages before being hidden in my dish. The meat in the lamb korma was tender (there's a positive!) but the dish again had zero flavor.

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by three or four people it was awesome and they seated us right away.  The whole experience was really good my only concern is that on the menu it claims that the food serves 4 people when in fact two people will probably still be hungry with one of these communal plates.  Granite, I eat alot but there was only enough for two people. Other than that it was a great experience and the food was delicious . We'll be back!

We tried a few things from the Korean American fusion menu.
Hubby's Kalbi was cooked to a perfect medium and it was oh so tender...geez...
My kiddo had the Terri Burger..5 napkins juicy...
I had the kimchi fried rice and garlic soy wings... Perfect.
My hubby didn't get the IPA draft he wanted because they were out, but the drafts we settled for were cold and fresh. I also tried a house cocktail called the New Fashioned..it was a bit sweet and the smaller ice watered down the drink.
The restaurant is beautiful and clean.

We tried their seafood pancake (delicious) and then their bao buns (fine). We had several sets of nigiri sushi which honestly were not that impressive. We ordered an uzu flavored dessert which was thoroughly enjoyed and a chocolate souffle--a highlight. However, our biggest complaints were the wide variances in portion sizes. The pancake was huge, only one bao bun for an expensive price, the yuzu dessert tiny, and the souffle enormous. You would never be able to predict if you could split something or needed to purchase two to enjoy. The service was also slow.

16392,4,"Delicious food in a relaxed, casual-nice atmosphere. We came here after a long day on the Road to Hana and driving all the way around so we were very tired and hungry! The people here were super-nice (as were most people we encountered in Hawaii) and we had a great time. Pretty pricey, but you get top-notch ingredients and preparation. We started things off with their Oysters Rockefeller Hawaiian Style, served with mango mignonette--divine! I got their seafood coconut curry, my friend got their baby back ribs and we shared a lilikoi (passionfruit brulee) for dessert. Everything was good, but it wasn't quite as good as I was hoping, considering their reputation and prices. My curry was a trifle too bland, although maybe I was supposed to put in more of the ""add-ins"" they provided for me: golden raisins and cashews, pineapple chutney, and toasted coconut shavings. My friend's baby back ribs were slathered in a bit too much sauce, and she only got a side of mashed potatoes with it--is it too much to ask for at least two sides at these prices? The lilikoi brulee was awesome, though, the perfect texture and served in a bowl made of almond brittle with a disc of nicely caramellized sugar on top, all on top of a bed of fresh berries, wow.

It's a complement and not a swipe at the hotel style.  We really enjoyed our stay there along with the layout, room, as well as friendly staff.

The hotel is perfect for those that want to get away, do nothing but relax.  Read a book by the pool or while take an afternoon nap in a hammock are about the most lively things going on there except for the chickens on the property.  The rooms are clean and have just the right immensities to make for a comfortable stay.

There is a restaurant on the property that serves lunch and dinner, but only does breakfast on the weekends.  There is also a bar attached to the restaurant if you want to sit and relax before dinner.  I highly recommend making reservations for dinner as it does get busy and seating is limited.

The lobby staff were all very pleasant as well as the maid and grounds staff.  Everyone smiled when you walked by, which was very nice to see.

Napua is located in the Mauan Lani resort complex so I expected it to be just your typical over-priced could-be-anywhere-in-the-world ""fancy"" restaurant.  I was so wrong.  Napua is owned not by the Mauna Lani Resort but by a local family over in Hamakua.  It's a bit of a farm-to-table operation in that the family also owns a 33 acre farm.  Most of the delicious, oh so fresh food they serve comes from their farm.  Most of the staff are part of the family and all of them also work on the farm.  So the end result is great food, the freshest ingredients, and an intimacy that you cannot find in any formulaic high end eatery.  Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable (she grows the food she served us, after all), very warm and personable.  The food from visual presentation to final bite was excellent.

RESTAURANT:

Location wise, Napua is one of the best on the island!  The restaurant is covered, but has a large patio and the inside can be exposed to the elements with doors around that open, weather permitting.  At the edge of the patio is a grassy lawn, which leads to the beach.  So, you can see the ocean from any table in the restaurant.  It is gorgeous and extremely picturesque.

SERVICE:

The service is fantastic.  Everyone exemplifies the aloha spirit.  During dinner service, there is often live music.

FOOD:

We ordered the octopus luau, calamari, Kaunamano Farms pork loin, and duck confit.  We had hoped to order the lamb, but they were ran out.  The octopus luau is great to look at and just as delicious to eat.  Overall, the presentation is fantastic and the food is very good.

Went just before sunset when there were only a few other people here.

I always get the Kula steak sandwich with a side of falafel in it (they charge too much for this) with an extra pita instead of rice.

I can't tell you anything else because I have never deviated from this dish, it is that good. The ice cream is definitely worth it.

Edit: lost another star because I tried something new, the falafel sandwich.

17556,4,"We lucked out and were able to do this trail on a dry day. It's a steep climb at the beginning but on a dry day it's easy. There are some ropes but some of them are so thin I couldn't imagine them helping much if it was muddy. Once up the steep part it's a fairly flat walk to the 1st pill box, the view is nice but it is slightly obstructed. To find the 2nd pill box, from the 1st pill box turn towards the Mauka and look LEFT. Walk towards the giant rocks, it won't look like a path at first but you'll see one shortly. Based on another post that helped up, follow this path but don't get sucked into the mountain side too much or you won't find it. It's not much further

The view is better here, it's not a 360 but it's a nice view of the beach below. We never made it here for sunset but feel like on a dry day this is a totally do-able hike for sunset.

17567,5,"A great, moderately difficult hike. Very steep and muddy climb through beautiful forest with some views along the way.

There are two paths, one direct and one indirect. I would recommend taking the left fork, which is the only trail you can really see, on the way up, as it has ropes and good coastal views. This will take you directly to the top.

We heard that there were two pillboxes but were unable to find the second. However, you can see the main pillbox, and walking through the open woods you can see the entrance to a bunker and a few artillery mounts. The flora completely changes on the way up, from beach scrub and tropical plants to ghostly

The indirect path is more obvious on the way down. Head back along the path and you will see a clear trail on the left side that will take you up and then down. This route leads you through more forest and is a little less slick than the main trail, but has no ropes. It will take you past a large open cave which makes a great photo, and eventually merges with the main trail at the bottom quarter of the mountain.",Ehukai Pillbox Hike,"['Hiking area', 'Tourist attraction']","Short but steep hike passing several WWII ""pillbox"" bunkers, with summit views of the North Shore.",1.1737431387127413e+20_1528077020037,

17637,4,"Here is an unexpected find in the heart of seedy Chinatown on the corner of the infamous N.Hotel St. and Smith St.

We stepped into this darkened yet well lit restaurant off the sunny street to find an inviting layout that was comfortable with an eclectic decor which relaxes you from the get go. There was an assortment of options for social distancing seating during this COVID-19 situation, but you can tell that even during normal times, there would be a good layout.

The staff were all very inviting and friendly while maintaining their own safety spaces.  We were greeted immediately and offered seating options.  Hand sanitizer was also available right when you walked in the door from a no touch dispenser.

We came on a Saturday, so there was only the brunch menu available. It was a bit of a disappointment, but our fault for not checking first.  There were adequate options to choose from despite not having the full lunch menu available.

I ordered the Tavern Burger.  The burger was probably one of the best gourmet burgers I have ever had.  Cooked to perfection, they got my order of medium rare perfectly.  Everything from the bun to the accudiments were all put together for a picture perfect burger that was very delicious. The only disappointing part of this dish were the french fries. Not sure what it was, but they just were not very good. The fries were limp and didn't seem to have been cooked properly.

My partner got the lobster roll.  Although the lobster was excellent and generous, there was just something missing about this sandwich.  It needed something more to the lobster and mayonnaise and seemed incomplete.  I think if you were a minimalist for food who like thing plain, you would like this dish.

All in all, it was a good experience and would recommend others to try it.",Livestock Tavern,"['American restaurant', 'Restaurant']","Cool, brick-lined venue dishing up seasonally inspired American plates, plus classic cocktails.",1.10224932759879e+20_1597869289029,

17640,3,"Bottom Line: Good Drink, 1 for 2 on the food, inconsistent service, hesitant to recommend.

We started with the Hen of the Wood Mushroom, which was fantastic. The fried pork belly and asparagus were great accents.

The old fashion was recommended by the waitresss an didn't disappoint. The bitters were the perfect accompaniment to the bourbon. Although the menu stated that the bourbon was Livestock selected Maker's Mark...it was actually Elijah Craig? It was even printed as Makers on my receipt...Either way, well executed besides the confusion on what's inside.

We selected the leg of lamb as our main. The lamb was sliced thin and seared. This led to the meat being overdone and jerky like. I think it would been executed better as a roast ad cut to order. Some of the vegetables were underdone. Overall a promising dish that underwhelmed.

One strang side note, the bathroom soap was way overpowering, interfering with the taste of my drink and meal.

I would've liked to share these issues with the staff, but I wasn't asked how my meal went.

Overall, I would be hesitant to recommend this restaurant...as the issues I experienced seem to be apart of the normal operation.

I enjoyed the first half of my SCALLOPS AND BONE MARROW GNOCCHI, but it may have felt a little too greasy by the end. There is a fine line between greasy and rich, and it can be difficult when working with marrow. I preferred the SEARED DUCK BREAST.

For desserts, their SEASONAL DESSERT was a Chocolate Ice Cream Cake and was disappointing, but their New York Cheesecake was surprisingly delicious.

However, it was a convenient straight shot 25-min bus ride from our hotel in Waikiki.

A local took us here and introduced us to Livestock Tavern -- I would definitely visit again.

We had the octopus appetizer. I generally don't eat straight up squid of octopus unless it's in takoyaki or fried to a crisp in calamari so having grilled octopus was interesting.  The texture was very soft which I hear is hard to achieve with octopus.

For the main course, I had the braised short ribs which were off the charts tender and flavorful.  It's a definite reorder the next time I visit.

If you come at the right time you can see the live band play some great music while you relax with your friends. When there is a band make sure to bring something for them. The bar has a cover charge when a live band is playing. Its not a lot and its supporting the local talent.

A few negatives though. The bar is upstairs so that hinders handy capable people or people not very good with stairs. The bathrooms are small and only meant for one person at a time. Male and female bathrooms. If you want or care about beer on tap, they don't have any. But they do have bottles and an good assortment of liquors.

Both a negative and a positive, there is a good amount of parking down the street. but it is paid parking. So keep that in your budget or get a ride.

But I would definitely recommend this bar. But I like the grunge New Orleans look.

17851,4,"Okay, so I went with two older ladies who are Visayan and have been there apparently quite a bit. So yeah, we might have gotten more preferential service than if I went alone. But, the service was very sweet in general, even with the other tables I noticed. Biggest lure seems to be the all you can eat buffet. It's a pretty small one, though.

Lechon Kawali was bright and fresh and the skin was well rendered. Lumpia was crispy and not overly greasy; sauce was basic but a nice complement.

The Halo Halo is the size of a child's head, so be prepared to eat something very cold very quickly. Not really an individual kind of serving. Then again, maybe that's all you want for the day. In which case, yes, it's an individual serving. ;)

A pretty clean and bright, if old, establishment.

Bathroom available on site. Unisex and just the one though.

Free parking, although it gets very tight. Be prepared to park on-street in the little road in front, running parallel to Farrington Highway, during dinner hour.

Everything seems under seasoned, perhaps the only Chinese establishment I've been to that doesn't use MSG? Everything looks really good but it's quite plain when you eat it.

17986,2,"The food was very good up to the standards.  The wait was very long due to the fact that the Manager decided to give her friend almost all of several dishes. This in turn obviously through the kitchen into a downward spiral to play catch up.  After which she charged her 50.00 for over 150.00 worth of food.
So we wait and wait one other employee quotes us a price for a side item.  We get our other items and proceed to checkout.  At the checkout the girl tries to charge us twice as much.  I ask for the manager and guess who shows up the girl that started this by  giving away all the food that was on the line.  Then she asked the other girl what she told us she told her and still didn't give us the side dish for the quoted price. This after giving away over a hundred dollars worth of food.

For our appetizers, we tried the short ribs and dim sum sampler. Both were excellent and great for sharing. Really loved the short ribs!

For our mains, we shared a rainbow roll, Kung Pao Chicken, kalbi short ribs and chef Morimoto's signature dish (buri bop). Everything was excellent! Great for sharing! The buri bop is prepared at the table and is super fun to watch.

We were expecting similar clean and unique dishes at a restaurant that bore his name.  Sadly this is an Americanized restaurant.  Dishes are designed to cater the tastes of the masses.

I believe Morimoto may have a unique shop else where that focuses on his trademark clean and unique dishes.  But the Waikiki location is on part with the usual Asian style restaurants.

18226,4,"I love this hike for an adventure and nice swim after. From my impression Oahu doesn't seem to have as lush waterfalls as some of the other Hawaiian islands. This one is an exception. My husband and I have hiked there 2 times previously trying to find the waterfall and missing the correct turn. You access the falls from the Manana Trail. This trail leads you down the valley, watch out for tree roots there's plenty of them to stub your toes on. There comes a fork in the trail about 45 to an hour in where you can either go left and up or right and down. GO LEFT! Previously we had always thought to take the trail going down because we thought it would lead us to the falls. Take the trail on the left going up trust me you will get there. Once you reach the falls there is a lot of rope climbing down the rocks to get to the pools below. The water was cold but so refreshing! They also have ropes so you can swing, landing in the water, which is deep enough to do safely. This hike can get very muddy, I recommend hiking barefoot since it's much easier than slipping around in shoes. Definitely one of my favorite hikes so far.",Waimano Falls,['Tourist attraction'],"Dramatic cascade tumbling into a rocky pool popular for swimming, reached by testing forest trail.",1.0609581269555598e+20_1509081865181,

We finally decided that for most of the food, we prefer the taste and cost of the other place but no one can beat Phuket Thai on their fried chicken and calamari (neither of which I consider Thai food).  So while this place has decent Thai food, it's a bit more expensive than the other place (probably because we are paying for the ambiance of eating in a restaurant whereas the other place is mostly take out), we still will consider this place for gatherings.

The fried chicken here is just so good.  I don't know what it is about it.  It has a nice batter on it that's not too overpowering, and the chicken is always juicy.  The calamari is the best I've had anywhere in Hawaii so far.  The breading is minimal but the calamari itself is always perfect.

Although there was a short wait to be seated due to the packed restaurant...I can now see why!  The food is simply delicious!  The menu is short, consise and offers a first rate culinary parade of hits to make your stomach smile.

This was my first trip there, so it was a breakfast trek as it was early in the day.  I had the cheesey grits with bacon and eggs and also ordered a side of the smashed potatoes.  It was mind blowingly good is all I can say for such a simple dish!  My friend had the grits with eggs and shrimp and it was on par and cooked to perfection.  The presentation was outstanding and the portions prefect for the reasonable price.  The champagne mimosa's were a great treat to the dishes for breakfast as well.

However, those who they did have were very charming. The portions are relatively small with lots of well-prepared vegetables, but the desserts are large especially the fried ice cream which gives you two huge balls and is very much sufficient for two people to share. Pad Thai as generous as well, but I could strongly taste the bacon grease in which it was cooked. The salmon was excellent as were the prawns and scallops.

18714,2,"We wanted some good down to earth Chinese food so was anticipating some great food. We walked it all the diners were on the lanai side so we were promptly seated after clearing a table for us.  The place is well decorated and open. However it's a bit warm with air conditioning inside for guests that don't like the heat.  But the temperature cooled down a lot after our dinner.

Dishes on the menu covered a lot and staff recommended the fish but we weren't into it. Other diners seems to enjoyed it a lot.

Like usual I always go with a basic wonton soup if they have it.  A good Chinese Restaurant should be have a decent wonton soup right? Gau zi or gyoza, Garlic eggplant, stir fry beef, Singapore rice noodles,  salt and pepper shrimp.

We waited over 20 mins to get the soup, a long for something simple.  Like many restaurants they used the thick noodles which not made for wonton soup. Wonton loosely means swallowing clouds so it should be lite. Soup itself is completely bland. Just tasted like vegetable blanching water. It should have nice flavor broth either seafood or chicken,  hint of white pepper and some crunch greens. To my horror the filling is sliced lapchiong (cured dried Chinese sausage). Again should have lite (cloud) texture with minced pork and some shrimp.  NOT scraps!

Gyoza dough were undercooked though filling tasted good.  Not sure it's store bought...

Singapore fried noodles was still very chewy. A result of not soaking the rice noodles long enough and add hardly any curry tastes. Curry the flavor the dish is known for.

Other dishes ordered all have wonderful fragrance when they were served but all too salty. Even though smelled great but all I can taste was salt. Everything was too oily.

I read the other reviews about how they contacted with tour guides. If this were true it's totally unethical especially the kids now also have to learn and lie about it.

We might give then another try but not as what I would consider a good restuarant that have serviced Lahaina for many years.",Fu Lin Chinese Restaurant,"['Chinese restaurant', 'Asian restaurant', 'Delivery Restaurant', 'Takeout Restaurant', 'Restaurant', 'Vegetarian restaurant']","Familiar Chinese eats in a relaxed setting, plus front porch seats across the street from the beach.",1.021524460683216e+20_1563853049241,

E got the duck with cannellini beans with ham which she ate to the bone, grandpa had the pink snapper, which he said was a bland fish, however he liked how the capers added such beautiful flavor with the spinach and the rest of his dish, and I had the beef filet which was more medium then medium rare, but was good because of how it was sauced and the sweet potato mash was a winner, so much so that E ate half of it and then asked is this sweet potato? Normally she avoids sweet potatoes at home. And dessert... Creme Caramel and Gateau Chocolate (sp?) were perfect.

The desserts were delicious and probably our favorite part. We were full without being stuffed and hating ourselves with our main entree and 1 dessert to share. My only negative was the bread.

I completely messed up ordering here, but it was still amazing. There is small print on the menu saying you can add ice cream and I missed it (rookie mistake). Then they apparently have Lilikoi as a secret menu item since someone after me asked about it and ordered it even though it's not on the menu.

Poor ordering skills aside, I got Da Mango One and it was delicious. The ice was shaved perfectly (very fine). Their purees and syrups were handmade. When I got to the bottom of it there was actually extra syrup so no plain ice. I love mango too, so it wasn't all bad even if I didn't get Lilikoi.

19022,1,"I first went to La Spezia last July.  I really enjoyed the food, service and ambiance.   I've since recommended it to several people.  In my job, I find myself frequently in a position to make such recommendations.   Tonight I suggested my daughter and her boyfriend go there for a romantic dinner on their last night in Kauai.  Huge mistake on my part. They checked in with the host by 6.30, and were told to expect a 15 minute wait.  After watching multiple groups who arrived after them get seated, they were seated around 7.15.  When they inquired two different times about the wait, the host was cut and dismissive.  Waitress was minimally attentive,  and when finally served, ravioli was cold and veal was marginal.  My daughter and her boyfriend have both worked as wait staff, and are very sympathetic about busy nights in restaurants.   However, they feel they were treated indifferently, perhaps due to their age  (early 20s), and a mistaken impression that they would not tip well.  I was disappointed in their evening, and embarrassed by my recommendation.

19110,4,"Depending on if the owner of the condo uses the on site management company, it can add to some extra stress. We had the washing machine break in the condo we rented through VRBO while we were staying there, and when we went to the management company, they wouldn't help at all. Makes sense since the owners of the condo are taking business away from the company. We had to deal with the owners on the mainland while we were stuck with a mess. They accused us of having broke their washer and dryer since it had worked for them for the five months they wee staying there.  When we finally convinced the owners that we are not idiots and their washer just broke, they finally started to work to get a repairman out.

On the plus side, owners can charge less to allow people to stay in their condo when they don't have to pay the management company.

19144,4,"After a morning visit to Haleakala National Park in the morning and a few more site seeing stops along the way Westward, this place is must do for lunch.  Their small but fantastic menu of farm fresh meats from the ranch is just amazing.

We had been here 5 years ago and I enjoyed an incredible elk burger, but they were out this time, but to my pleasure, enjoyed a venison hamburger steak.  To me honest, I regretted not getting it as a burger, but it enjoyed it all the same.  They grill up a generously sized venison patty cooked perfectly at medium rare.

I was also very pleased with their version of macaroni salad.  It was the normal bland mayo, pasta, and a few shreds of carrot.  It was a tasty and well prepared salad side that went well with the meat.

There was also a lilikoi cheesecake bar that was very good.  They don't make it themselves, but it is from friends of the owners, so all local.

After you grab a bite, walk across the street to MauiWine and enjoy some local spirits.  If you arrive at 1:30pm, there is a walking tour of this historic estate that is very nice and informative.

By the time she found out a few bites in eating it she was sick and nauseous.

One week you forgot to put her guacamole on the side and left it out completely, the next week you poisoned her with spicy food which she takes heartburn pills for.

I had the super nachos with shredded pork which I didn't particularly care for. It had way too much cheese (the cheese is shredded which they microwave when they prepare it). I think ground beef would have been a better meat selection instead of the pork. I really like the nachos at Taco Del Mar.
Several others in my family had various versions of their burrito which they really liked. My youngest son had a quesadilla which he said was slightly better than Taco Bell.
The prices are very reasonable. I would visit again but I would not order the nachos.

I never had a interview I sat there for an hour then was told you do this you do that put that there that goes here and there and that was it. I never knew who my boss was. I was fired by text message and it was not sent to me it was sent to a 3rd party. Someone else had to tell me I no longer work there. So unprofessional. They steal my tips.

Two examples of this are true Mainstays of Hoku's; the fried ahi poke musubi (the best musubi I have ever had) and work fried soft shell crab.
The prime rib and rack of lamb we're a perfect medium rare, juicy and tender. The king crab legs were succulent. I loved the shrimp and asparagus tempura as well as the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. They have pokes, shrimp cocktail, sushi, ahi sashimi, salads and much more. All is of exceptional quality.

19497,3,"Hey, they got a better qualities since my first visit (review from that in below)
I'm glad I had an opportunity to go back there! For the quality of fish...now this place is the best Sushi deal in town! (I mean...There's more pricey Sushi places with the equally or better  quality of fish out there but this is the best price!)
Because of that it's now even more hard to make a reservation nor walk in so I def recommend to book way ahead of time.
Here's why I only give them one more star than 3 more...I understand they get busy, overwhelming n all however whenever you bother the customers you MUST always check what's going on the table first!!!
While we are waiting on our check this manager lady rudely came up to our table by saying there's another customers are waiting for your table next so to hurry and leave already!  Wow! Ofcourse we snapped back at her by telling her that we are not the one dragging our time longer, hugging the table YOU are!  We told her how rude she inturrupting us in this way but she just said yea yea n left.
I was really excited to bring my friends over here n we really had a great time but this lady totally ruined our experience at the end. Btw her name is Kayo. She should learn what a customer service is again for real.

Previous review from 2017...
it's okay. I was very excited about this place and not so much satisfaction after wards... yea, they're clean and nice because it's a brand new sushi place but for that prices I expected to be better quality of fish, sushi. out of my orders Uni(which is my favorite) and Scallop were too fishy to eat.

Well got a millennial who tried to go back and fourth as to it's their job to clean table no matter what. I asked for a manager who was worst than the millennial with all that street attitude, telling they did their job and have to clean the table two minutes after people get up. I WASN'T FINISHED WITH MY MEAL AND WAS ORDERING DESSERT  and waiting for a box to go. When she the manager treated me in her grandiosity, this place is in Kailua with a brush off and replaced the meal and a slice cheesecake I felt it was a shut up and take what we give you.

He recommended the mango key lime cheesecake for our dessert, and it was so rich, flavorful, and body that three people could barely finish it.

19776,5,"Part of the 5-star rating is based on the fact that this location actually has the FULL Cheesecake Factory menu, unlike the other location on the island.  Yes!!!!  I'm finally able to order my favorite dish (White Bean Chicken Chili) on the island!!!  I'm so happy!!!

So happy, in fact, that I went there about twice a week for about two or three weeks right after they opened.  It helped that I was on vacation, perfect timing.  I definitely recommend that, even though this location definitely gives less rice with the chili than mainland locations I've frequented.  It definitely works though.  Usually, there's just enough rice.  Other times, I have to be diligent in doling out spoonfuls with the beans and chili.

Two other favorites are the Thai Lettuce Wraps-often ordered as my meal and the Carmel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake.  I don't eat the chocolate on top since I'm not a huge chocolate fan.  A close second is the Red Velvet cheesecake.  Both are very rich and I rarely eat either all at once.

TIP:  Since this is a new location, it has been even more packed than some other locations during the lunch hours, so I'd be patient with the wait.

Okay.. the food.
Usually my family and i share and give taste samples..  maybe they were too hungry, i dont know. They inhaled their incredibly large portions, and i admit, i was enjoying mine too.  I had a combination plate that consisted of chicken, mashed potatoes, and thick cuts of steak, smothered in mushrooms.

The food was good.
Prices are a bit high, but quality is nice.  You get both quality and quantity.

Of course cheesecakes will make you gain 20lbs by looking at their beautiful display case, standing and trying to decide what to order.    That was the most difficult part of our time there.

19882,1,"Husband and I typically frequent this location (kapolei) and order two items consistently. First the grilled salmon and the other skinnylicious medallions. This evening I had family emergency to attend to so left abruptly without my phone. My husband picked me up with our young granddaughters on his way to work. We decided to order from this location with hesitation. Past few times our order was inconsistent. However with situation at hand we really had heart set on the medallion meal. As i didn't have my phone and husband running late to work he had a coworker pick him up and left me with cash enough for the meal (medallions and cheesecake) and tip. I waited for a server over 30 minutes and asked an employee to get a server for me and he ignored me. Luckily a patron came along and helped me get a server as I had the girls sleeping in the car. Finally a server comes out with my food and I check it because past few times they have jipped me on the asparagus and I added a note on order to please put full servings of asparagus. I could not believe what I saw when I opened lid to entree, after the day I had and seeing how messed up the order was I wanted to cry so frustrated. It was smaller portion than normal, even for skinny, and if only had like 4 soggy skinny pieces of aspargus and didn't see mushrooms. It was just mush. I have seen TV dinners look better. Not to mention it was cold.Very disappoining for being expensive. I told manager and instead of being honest or valuing a repetive customer he was rude and arrogant kept claiming that's the skinny size and didn't even acknowledge how horrible it was. I truly wish I was able to take a pic of it, as my words dont properly express how horrible it was. He offered to redo it, I figured if that dish is going to be an issue try something simple like the salmon, I had already been there an hour. Then I find out its 10 dollars more, the previous order with cheesecake was 27 and then I learn it's now 35 before tip. Manager was very rude about the whole thing and besides not valuing its customers, belittling me because my husband left me with what was expected and I had no phone with me. He tried to say it was my fault for not calling and saying I was there. It does NOT say please call to let us know you're here. Also, that does not explain the poor execution of the meal.  I waited for an hour and had to leave empty handed, and feeling belittled by the managers behavior. Food was not good quality he knows it and didn't honor it. I ended up having to go to cpk where I should have gone in first place. They are consistent with food and value its customers.

The entre I ordered was grilled steak medallion and tasted amazing, perfectly seasoned. When I was more than half way through eating, I looked down and found a dead house fly under a piece of meat. My boyfriend called the waiter immediately and he took it back to the kitchen, came back and asked if I wanted another. At that point I just wanted to leave, so we asked for the check.

It's the principal of it that makes me mad tips for good service are based on the price of the meal and not on the states version of sales tax. Why should we be expected to tip on tax?
